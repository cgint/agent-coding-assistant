| Short description of feature and its capabilities | The Campaign Orchestrator's Budget Recommendations feature is an **AI-powered capability** that **optimizes the distribution of an advertiser's overall budget across Google Performance Max (PMax) campaigns within one scope**, which Google typically optimizes in isolation.  Its core functionality involves analyzing individual campaign performance metrics, such as ROAS and ad spend, to **automatically suggest optimal budget allocations** that align with broader business goals, thereby **maximizing profitability and efficiency** and saving manual effort.  Recommendations are dynamically generated when the overall budget differs from the sum of campaign budgets or when a campaign is "limited by budget" (defined as daily spend above 90% of its daily budget in the last 14 days). Advertisers can apply these recommendations individually or globally, which then triggers a one-way synchronization to Google Ads. This allows for comprehensive, goal-oriented ad spend allocation while providing the flexibility to exclude specific campaigns from the automated process |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | The Budget Recommendations feature within the Campaign Orchestrator addresses the core problem of Google Performance Max (PMax) campaigns typically optimizing their budgets in isolation, leading to a lack of a comprehensive, goal-oriented strategy across all campaigns. This often results in manual, time-consuming efforts for advertisers to reallocate spend to align with their broader business objectives.  Its primary use case is to **optimize the distribution of an advertiser's overall budget across multiple Google Performance Max campaigns**. Instead of campaigns operating as independent silos, the Campaign Orchestrator's AI analyzes the "bigger picture" to direct budget where it will deliver the greatest impact in line with defined business goals, thereby maximizing profitability and efficiency and saving manual effort.  Key capabilities include:   * **AI-powered optimization**: The system uses AI to analyze individual campaign performance, considering metrics like ROAS and ad spend, to suggest optimal budget allocations. * **Strategic Budget Allocation**: It intervenes when the overall budget set by the advertiser differs from the sum of individual campaign budgets, or when a campaign is identified as "limited by budget". A campaign is considered "limited by budget" if its daily spend exceeds 90% of its daily budget over the last 14 days. * **Performance-based shifts**: The system intelligently shifts budget towards campaigns that perform better (e.g., higher ROAS) and have room for more spend, or away from those underperforming or unable to meet their target ROAS. * **Automation and Control**: Advertisers receive automated recommendations that can be applied individually per campaign or globally with a single click, which then triggers a one-way synchronization to Google Ads. This saves significant manual effort and human guesswork. * **Flexibility**: Users can opt out specific campaigns from receiving budget recommendations if they prefer to manage those manually. However, opting out campaigns means their performance will not be considered for the overall predicted performance calculations by the orchestrator. * **Dynamic Adjustments**: Recommendations are updated regularly, taking into account changes in overall goals, product assortment, and real-time campaign performance. It is generally recommended to apply budget recommendations at least once a week, or immediately if the overall budget is changed. |
| Who is it thought for? | **Advertisers** seeking to optimize the distribution of their overall ad budget across multiple PMax campaigns, aiming to maximize profitability and efficiency and reduce the manual effort typically required for budget allocation. This addresses the problem of PMax campaigns traditionally optimizing in isolation, which can lead to disjointed spending and time-consuming manual adjustments to align with broader business goals. |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | * **Overall Goal & Budget Definition**: An **overall goal and an overall budget must be set** within the platform, and these settings **must not be marked as "documentation only"**. This is crucial because the AI-powered recommendations rely on this "bigger picture" to strategically direct your budget across campaigns. * **Performance Score Capability Setup**: The **performance score capability needs to be fully set up**. This is fundamental as the orchestrator score, which underpins the recommendations, is derived from the inventory score and product goals. * **"Tree Based" Score Approach**: The **"Score Approach" for performance scoring must be configured as "Tree Based"**. If it's not, there are specific migration steps required to switch to this approach. * **Recommendation Generation Approach (Version 2)**: The **"Approach for Generating Recommendations" must be set to Version 2**. * **Data Availability for New Setups**: For newly configured scopes, the Campaign Calibrator (which generates these recommendations) requires **at least 3 days of data for budget balancing recommendations** to be calculated. * **Campaign Synchronization**: While not a strict precondition for generating recommendations, the **Campaign Sync feature** plays a vital role in applying these recommendations to Google Ads. It ensures that changes (like budget adjustments) made in the Campaign Orchestrator are automatically synchronized to your Google Ads campaigns. If Campaign Sync is not enabled, changes would need to be applied manually in Google Ads.   Once these preconditions are met, the system can then provide budget recommendations, particularly when your overall budget differs from the sum of individual campaign budgets or when specific campaigns are identified as "limited by budget" |
| What options are there for its configuration? | * **Enabling/Disabling Recommendations**: The primary setting is to **enable or disable** the recommendations within `Campaign Management > Settings > Recommendations`. * **Setting the Overall Budget and Goal**: A fundamental configuration involves defining an **overall goal and an overall budget** for the scope under `Goals & Budget > Overall Goal & Budget`. It's crucial that these are **not marked as "Documentation only"** attributes, as they serve as the "bigger picture" guiding the AI-powered recommendations for budget distribution. * **Campaign-Level Opt-Out**: Advertisers can **opt out individual campaigns** from receiving budget recommendations. This setting is found within the specific campaign's settings. If a campaign is opted out, its performance will **not be considered** for the overall predicted performance calculations by the orchestrator. * **Applying Recommendations**: Once recommendations are generated (which happens in real-time when the page is loaded), users can choose to **apply them individually** per campaign by clicking a hook, or **apply all at once** using the "Apply Recommendations" button. Applying recommendations triggers a one-way synchronization of these budget changes to Google Ads. * **Frequency of Application**: While recommendations are dynamic, it's considered **best practice to apply budget recommendations at least once a week**. Additionally, if the overall budget is changed, it is recommended to apply the budget recommendations **immediately** to reflect that change in campaign budgets. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | * **Understanding Recommendation Triggers and Logic**:    + Recommendations are generated when the **overall budget differs from the total sum of individual campaign budgets**, or when at least one campaign is identified as "**limited by budget**" (defined as daily spend above 90% of its daily budget in the last 14 days).   + The system aims to **shift budget towards campaigns that perform better** (e.g., higher ROAS) and have room for more spend, or away from those underperforming or unable to meet their target ROAS, to **maximize profitability and efficiency**.   + Very small recommended budget shifts (e.g., 1‚Ç¨) may not be displayed, as their effect would be insignificant.      * **Application and Synchronization**:    + Recommendations are calculated in real-time when the page is loaded, but do not change with every reload.   + You can **apply recommendations individually** per campaign or **apply all at once**.   + Applying recommendations triggers a **one-way synchronization to Google Ads**; settings in Google Ads are overwritten by the platform's settings.   + The **publishing process can take several minutes or hours**, depending on the size of the Merchant Center feed, as it is not a real-time system.      * **Opting Out Campaigns**:    + You can **opt out individual campaigns (eg. for special promotions)** from receiving budget recommendations in their specific settings.   + Be aware that **opted-out campaigns' performance will** ***not*** **be considered for the overall predicted performance calculations** by the Campaign Orchestrator.   + The overall budget used for recommendations will be adjusted to exclude the budgets of campaigns opted out or those with configuration errors. Opting out gives control, but can lead to "low adoption" of the full automation potential.      * **Best Practices for Application Frequency**:    + It is generally recommended to **apply budget recommendations at least once a week**.   + If you **change the overall budget, you should apply the budget recommendations immediately** for the changes to materialize in campaign budgets.   + Avoid frequent manual changes to campaigns outside the orchestrator, as these can conflict with the system's logic and potentially lead to an "unbalance".      * **Relationship with tROAS Recommendations**:    + Budget recommendations are independent of tROAS recommendations. However, tROAS recommendations are calculated *assuming* that you will simultaneously apply the recommended budget changes. Applying only a subset of recommendations might lead to outcomes not aligned with the overall goal. |

Campaign Performance Insights directly addresses this by providing deep and actionable data. * **Ensuring True Demand Generation**: It helps advertisers **identify if PMax is inflating results by cannibalizing existing brand search traffic** rather than driving new, incremental demand. * **Understanding Ad Spend Effectiveness**: By showing which channels PMax is using and where conversions are most effective, it helps **optimize ad spend distribution** and ensures that budget is focused on areas that drive profitability and efficiency. * **"Black Box" Problem of PMax**: It offers the transparency needed to understand "what's working" within PMax, enabling advertisers to "double down" on successful strategies. * **Limited Google Ads Reporting**: While Google Ads provides reporting, Campaign Performance Insights extends this by offering deeper, more tailored views, particularly for PMax, which may not be directly available in Google's native interface. |
| Who is it thought for? | **PPC Managers**: This feature directly addresses the main struggle of PPC Managers, which is the "lack of control and visibility within Google PMax". It provides the detailed, business-relevant insights needed to analyze, organize, and strategically push products for better PPC performance and sustainable growth |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | Campaign Performance Insights is an integral feature of the **Campaign Orchestrator** module, which is an AI-powered solution designed to provide advertisers with greater control, better business results, and actionable insights in Google Performance Max (PMax) campaigns. While the sources do not explicitly list separate preconditions solely for "Campaign Performance Insights," its functionality relies on the foundational setup of the broader Campaign Orchestrator and its underlying data processing capabilities.  Therefore, the preconditions for using Campaign Performance Insights generally align with the core setup requirements for the Campaign Orchestrator:   * **Overall Goal and Budget Definition**:    + An **overall goal and an overall budget must be defined** within the platform.   + These settings **must not be marked as "Documentation only"** attributes. This serves as a foundational "bigger picture" for the AI-powered recommendations and other functionalities that leverage these overarching goals. * **Performance Score Capability (Inventory Scoring) Setup**:    + The **performance score capability needs to be fully set up**.   + This capability assigns a score to each product based on smec's "tree-based" algorithm, which is crucial for multi-dimensional product segmentation and understanding product potential. * **Product Goals Enabled**:    + The **product goals must at least be enabled** within the platform's settings. While not strictly necessary to create specific product goals initially, their enablement is a technical prerequisite for the orchestrator score and integrated functionalities. * **Campaign Management Setup (for comprehensive views)**:    + Although Campaign Performance Insights can show aggregated data, for it to provide deep, business-relevant insights across *managed campaigns*, the **Campaign Management capability needs to be set up**. This includes setting up the export to Google Merchant Center and the synchronization of campaigns to Google Ads. * **Data Availability**:    + For the system to generate meaningful performance insights, **sufficient historical data from Google Ads** (and potentially other integrated sources like Merchant Center feeds) is required. For example, budget balancing recommendations require at least 3 days of data.   In essence, Campaign Performance Insights leverages the data and configurations established through the full setup of the Campaign Orchestrator, providing the transparency and detailed analysis that addresses the "black box" nature of platforms like Google PMax. |
| What options are there for its configuration? | Campaign Performance Insights (CPI) is primarily a **reporting and visualization feature** within the Campaign Orchestrator. Its "configuration" largely pertains to how users can **filter and view the displayed data** and how its underlying data sources (like product scoring and campaign setup) are configured elsewhere in the platform.  Here are the options for its configuration, distinguishing between direct user-facing filtering/comparison and the underlying data preparation:   1. **User-Facing Filtering and Comparison within CPI:**  * **Comprehensive Data Filtering**: Users can filter the aggregated performance information across all managed campaigns within the CPI interface. This allows for focused analysis:    + **By Ad Platform**: Filter data by **Google or Microsoft**.   + **By Campaign Type**: Filter by **campaign type** such as Performance Max, Search, Shopping, Demand Gen, or Video.   + **By Specific Campaigns**: Drill down into **specific campaigns**.   + **By Brands/Product Categories**: When diving into product-centric performance, users can **filter by specific brands** or product categories. * **Campaign Performance Insights (CPI) offers a drilldown function** to enable users to examine performance data at more granular levels. This capability allows for a deeper understanding of campaign and product performance beyond aggregated views    + **From Aggregated Campaign Performance to Specific Campaigns**: CPI provides aggregated performance information across all managed campaigns. Users can then **filter this data to view insights for specific campaigns**.   + **Into Product Performance Insights**: The feature allows users to **"dive deep into product performance insights"**. This means you can understand how specific product categories are performing.   + **To Individual Product Details**: Beyond categories, you can "see longtail distribution and **how each product performs** (impressions, clicks, costs, ROAS, AOV, internal product score and more)". This implies the ability to drill down to the level of individual products.   + **Filtering by Attributes**: When analyzing product-centric performance, you can **filter or "grab after certain things" like specific brands or product categories**. This allows you to explore the performance of defined groups of products. * **A/B Test Comparison Setup**: A notable capability is the **built-in functionality to compare different campaign setups for A/B testing**. Users can **define campaign sets as "Set A" and "Set B"** within the platform by applying filter criteria to their campaigns. This allows CPI to then display comparative insights for these defined sets.  2. **Underlying Data Configuration (Impacting what CPI displays):**   While not direct configurations *of* Campaign Performance Insights, these foundational setups within the Campaign Orchestrator heavily influence the data and granularity that CPI can present:   * **~~Inventory Scoring (Performance Score) Configuration~~**~~: The detailed product performance insights in CPI are based on the Inventory Score. This score is calculated using smec's "tree-based" algorithm, and its configuration involves setting up various parameters, contribution "weights" for different data points (like ROAS, conversions, clicks, impressions), and defining how products without historical data are scored. This complex configuration is typically~~ **~~managed by Solution Engineers~~** ~~at smec, not directly by the client or CSM.~~ * **~~Product Goals~~**~~: These can modify the Orchestrator Score (which is based on the Inventory Score) by adding "strategic signals" such as pushing products of a specific brand or high-margin products. Product goals are set up by enabling them and then defining specific goals with "Advertising Modes" and product filters. This influences which products appear in which performance clusters within CPI.~~ * **Product Exclusions**: Users can define sets of products to be excluded from advertising via "Product Exclusions". These products will not be scored by the orchestrator and will be marked with a `smec_excluded` custom label in Google Ads. This impacts which products' data appears in the actively managed campaigns within CPI. * **Custom Labels and Attributes**: The platform can import and process an "unlimited number of attributes" beyond Google's standard custom labels, which can then be used for more granular product segmentation and analysis within CPI. While configuring *which* attributes are imported might be a setup step, CPI then allows filtering/viewing based on these. * **Campaign Management Setup**: The availability and structure of campaigns displayed in CPI are a result of the setup within the Campaign Management capability, which handles the synchronization of campaigns and product assignments with Google Ads.   In essence, CPI itself is highly flexible in *how* you view and analyze data, but the deeper "configuration" of the insights' content (e.g., how a product's "score" is determined) occurs in upstream modules like Inventory Scoring and Product Goals. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | Campaign Performance Insights (CPI) itself is primarily a reporting and visualization tool, so its "best practices" largely relate to how users can effectively leverage the insights it provides and how the underlying campaign management is optimally configured to generate meaningful data for CPI.  Here are the recommendations for best practice:   * **For A/B Testing / Geo-split Tests**:    + Utilize the built-in functionality to **compare different campaign setups using "Set A" and "Set B"** within the smec platform for geo-split tests. This allows for direct comparison of treatment and control campaigns.   + During a geo-split test, **avoid making major changes** (campaign or asset group structure) to the experiment groups. If changes are absolutely necessary, they should be discussed with the Data Science Team and mirrored to both control and treatment groups to maintain consistent conditions.   + **Avoid early termination** of tests to gain truly reliable insights. * **For Acting on Performance Insights**:    + **Dive deep into product performance insights** to identify under- and overspending product types/brands.   + Use these insights to strategically **adjust product goals**. For example, assign "underspending" products to an "Aggressive" advertising mode for high-priority campaigns and "overspending" products to a "Conservative" mode for low-priority campaigns. * **For General PMax Campaign Management (monitored by CPI)**:    + **Reduce the frequency of significant changes** in PMax campaigns to give Google's algorithms time to learn and optimize. This is a general recommendation from Google itself.   + **Apply weekly updates for product assignments**.   + **Change tROAS targets ideally not more than once every two weeks**.   + **Adjust budget (for significant changes) ideally not more than once every two weeks**.   + ~~For product allocation based on the tree-based score, a typical best practice for a 3-way split (High/Mid/Low) is:~~      - **~~Low score campaign: maximum 40% of products~~**~~.~~     - **~~Mid score campaign: around 50-55% of products~~**~~.~~     - **~~High score campaign: 5-10% of products~~**~~.~~ * **For Budget and tROAS Recommendations (generated by Campaign Orchestrator and visible in CPI)**:    + **Apply budget recommendations at least once a week**. You can apply them more often if needed.   + When changing the **overall budget, apply the budget recommendations right away** so the new budget takes effect in the campaign budgets.   + **Do not apply tROAS recommendations more often than once a week** for them to work effectively.   + **Read the tooltip texts** provided for each recommendation.   + **Do not use the platform's budget and tROAS recommendations during Black Friday**, as they have not been trained for that specific seasonal data. * **~~For Long-term Product Pushing~~**~~:~~    + ~~For products that should be prioritized long-term based on strategic business information (e.g., high margin, low return),~~ **~~use Product Goals~~**~~.~~   + ~~Assign an~~ **~~Aggressive, MoreAggressive, or SuperAggressive advertising mode~~** ~~to these products in their product goals to give them a higher score and increase their likelihood of being assigned to higher-priority campaigns, driving more budget towards them.~~ * **Underlying System Configurations impacting CPI**:    + Ensure the **overall goal and budget are defined and not marked as "Documentation only"** attributes, as this is a technical prerequisite for recommendations and the orchestrator score to function correctly.   + For comprehensive product performance analysis, the **Inventory Scoring (performance score capability) must be fully set up**.   + While defining product goals, it is recommended to enable them as it is a technical requirement for integrated functionalities that feed into CPI.   + When using Google Ads data for evaluation, **ensure regular, preferably daily, access to client data** to monitor deviations promptly.   + For CPA targeting in Inventory Scoring, while conversions should be weighted heavily, **avoid pushing ROAS contribution to zero** as this could potentially harm revenue. |

| Short description of feature and its capabilities | **Campaign Sync** is a core Campaign Orchestrator feature that **one-directionally synchronizes campaign settings from the smec platform to Google Ads**.  It updates campaign attributes like name, status, bid strategy (tROAS), and budget. Campaign Sync also automatically applies asset and listing group structures from a **template campaign** in Google Ads to all managed campaigns, ensuring consistency. This automation aims to save time and prevent redundant work. Users can also opt out of syncing specific attributes for individual campaigns. |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | **Campaign Sync** is a core feature of the Campaign Orchestrator designed to **automate the synchronization of campaign settings and structures from the smec platform directly into Google Ads**.  Use Cases  The primary use case for Campaign Sync is to allow users to **efficiently manage and automatically apply campaign configurations, budget and tROAS recommendations, and asset group structures** defined within the smec platform to their corresponding Google Ads campaigns. It enables advertisers and CSMs to:   * **Leverage AI-powered recommendations:** Apply the platform's suggested budget and tROAS values to Google Ads campaigns without manual intervention. * **Maintain consistency across campaigns:** Ensure that multiple Performance Max campaigns that share common assets and structural settings are consistently updated, typically by utilizing a designated "template campaign" in Google Ads. * **Streamline campaign management:** Automate the one-way transfer of changes from the smec platform to Google Ads, reducing manual effort and potential for errors .   Problems Solved  Campaign Sync addresses several key challenges faced by PPC managers in Google Performance Max:   * **Eliminating Manual Effort and Double Work:** It solves the pain point of "spending hours on manual campaign setup and tweaks" by **automating the synchronization of campaign-level parameters** such as campaign name, status (active/inactive), bid strategy (tROAS), and budget from the smec platform to Google Ads. This prevents users from having to perform repetitive updates directly in Google Ads. * **Ensuring Structural Consistency:** It addresses the problem of campaigns not adapting fast enough when "inventory or business goals shift" by **automatically updating asset groups and listing groups** in Google Ads based on a template campaign and the Campaign Orchestrator strategies defined in the platform. This ensures that changes made to the central template (e.g., adding new assets) are automatically inherited by all associated campaigns. * **Preventing Configuration Drift:** Since the synchronization is **one-directional from the smec Platform to Google Ads**, it ensures that whatever settings are configured in the platform are applied, even if they conflict with direct changes made in Google Ads. This helps maintain the intended strategy and prevents unintended deviations in campaign performance. |
| Who is it thought for? | **PPC Managers and Advertisers**: These users aim to **efficiently manage and automatically apply campaign configurations, budget and tROAS recommendations, and asset group structures** defined within the smec platform to their Google Ads campaigns. It directly addresses the pain point of "spending hours on manual campaign setup and tweaks" |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | **Campaign Sync**, a core feature of the Campaign Orchestrator, is designed to **automate the synchronization of campaign settings and structures from the smec platform directly into Google Ads**. For it to be used effectively, several preconditions must be met within both the smec platform and Google Ads.  The main preconditions for Campaign Sync include:   * **Platform Capability Setup**    + The **Campaign Orchestrator module** must be active and set up within the smec platform.   + The **performance score capability** needs to be configured and running, as this forms the basis for product segmentation and insights that inform campaign structures.   + An **overall goal and budget** must be defined in the platform. These should not be marked as "documentation only," as they are crucial for the orchestrator's functionality.   + **Product goals** must at least be enabled, as they help influence the orchestrator score and product-to-campaign assignments.   + The **Campaign Management capability** itself, which encompasses Campaign Sync, must be enabled within the platform. * **Google Ads Account & Merchant Center Integration**    + A **Google Ads account** must be linked to the smec platform. This requires providing the **Ads Account ID, Authorizing Ads Account ID, and a valid Refresh Token** within the Campaign Management settings in the platform. This authentication grants the platform permission to perform actions in the Google Ads account.   + A **Google Merchant Center** must be connected, requiring its ID and a valid refresh token.   + A **supplemental feed** needs to be created and configured within the Merchant Center, and its ID and the relevant custom label index must be entered into the platform. This supplemental feed is used by the platform to populate custom label values on products, enabling their assignment to specific campaigns. * **Google Ads Template Campaign**    + A dedicated **template campaign must be created in the Google Ads account**. This campaign should typically be paused as it serves as a blueprint rather than an active advertising campaign.   + This template campaign needs to have its **asset groups and listing groups set up** as desired, as Campaign Sync will use this structure to update corresponding groups in all managed campaigns.   + The **Template Campaign ID** from Google Ads must be specified within the smec platform's Campaign Sync settings for each managed campaign. It's also possible to use multiple template campaigns for more complex needs.   Once these preconditions are met, Campaign Sync can be enabled globally within the Campaign Management settings and optionally on an individual campaign level. This enables the one-directional flow of settings (such as campaign name, status, bid strategy, and budget) and asset/listing group updates from the smec platform to Google Ads. Users can also **opt out of syncing specific attributes** for individual campaigns if they prefer direct Google Ads management for those elements |
| What options are there for its configuration? | **Campaign Sync**, a core feature of the Campaign Orchestrator, offers various options for its configuration, allowing users to control how campaign settings and structures are synchronized from the smec platform to Google Ads.  The configuration options can be applied at different levels and for specific attributes:   * **Global vs. Individual Campaign Configuration**:    + Campaign Sync can be **enabled or disabled globally** within the Campaign Management settings of the smec platform.   + Additionally, users can **override these global settings** for individual campaigns, allowing for more granular control. * **Key Campaign Attributes for Synchronization**: Campaign Sync facilitates the one-way transfer and updates of several campaign-level attributes from the smec platform to Google Ads. These include:    + **Campaign Name**: The name of the Performance Max campaign in Google Ads is synced, often in combination with a configurable prefix defined in the platform (e.g., `(AT:smecPMax) Template Campaign - Do not remove or enable`).   + **Campaign Status**: The status (active/inactive) of the campaign in Google Ads is synchronized with the status set in the smec platform. If a campaign is paused in Google Ads but active in the platform, Campaign Sync will reactivate it.   + **Bid Strategy**: Currently, the **tROAS (Target Return on Ad Spend) bid strategy** is supported for synchronization.   + **Budget**: The daily budget for the campaign is synced from the smec platform to Google Ads. Budget recommendations, generated by the platform, can also be applied through Campaign Sync.   + **Asset Groups and Listing Groups**: Campaign Sync is responsible for updating asset groups and listing groups in Google Ads. These updates are based on a template campaign and the Campaign Orchestrator's defined strategies. * **Leveraging Template Campaigns**: A crucial part of Campaign Sync's configuration involves the use of **template campaigns** in Google Ads.    + A template campaign is typically a **paused campaign in Google Ads** that serves as a blueprint for assets and structural settings.   + All managed campaigns can **inherit assets and listing group structures** from this template, ensuring consistency.   + The **Template Campaign ID** from Google Ads must be specified within the smec platform's Campaign Sync settings for each managed campaign.   + The feature supports the use of **multiple template campaigns**, which can be assigned to different campaigns in the Campaign Orchestrator to cater to specific client needs, such as organizing campaigns by category or using different asset group configurations. * **Opt-Out Options**: Users have the flexibility to **opt-out of syncing specific attributes** for individual campaigns. This is useful if certain attributes are preferred to be managed directly within Google Ads. The opted-out campaigns are labeled in the campaign overview. * **Synchronization Schedule**: Users can set a **schedule for how often Campaign Sync should run**. The default schedule for Campaign Sync is hourly, every six hours.   For Campaign Sync to be effectively used, several preconditions must be met, including linking the Google Ads account and Merchant Center, creating a supplemental feed, and enabling relevant Campaign Orchestrator capabilities (like performance score, overall goal, and product goals) within the smec platform. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | **Campaign Sync**, a core feature of the Campaign Orchestrator, is most effective when utilized to fully leverage the automation and centralized management capabilities of the smec platform for Google Ads campaigns, particularly Performance Max campaigns. Adhering to certain best practices ensures optimal performance and consistency:   * **Centralized Control and Full Synchronization in smec Platform**:    + As a general rule, it is recommended to **keep all global Campaign Sync settings enabled** within the Campaign Management settings of the smec platform. This ensures that all relevant campaign attributes, such as campaign name, status (active/inactive), bid strategy (tROAS), and budget, are consistently synchronized from the smec platform to Google Ads.   + The smec platform should be considered the **primary source of truth** for campaign settings, as Campaign Sync operates as a one-directional synchronization from the smec platform to Google Ads. Any settings configured in the platform will overwrite direct changes made in Google Ads.   + While flexibility to opt out of syncing specific attributes for individual campaigns exists, it should be used judiciously. Over-opting out can lead to inconsistencies and make managing campaigns difficult. * **Effective Use of Template Campaigns**:    + Campaign Sync relies on a **template campaign in Google Ads** to apply asset and listing group structures across all managed campaigns. It is a best practice to designate a single template campaign as a blueprint for common assets and structural settings.   + Although the system technically allows assigning a different template campaign ID for each campaign in the Campaign Orchestrator, this approach is **not advised** as it "defeats the purpose of the feature". Instead, multiple template campaigns should be used strategically for *different sets* of campaigns (e.g., organized by category), not for every single campaign.   + The template campaign in Google Ads should generally be **paused**, as its role is to serve as a blueprint, not an active advertising campaign.   + Educating clients about the benefits of a single template campaign for managing assets and structures can save them considerable effort and prevent "double-work". * **Seamless Integration with Recommendations**:    + Campaign Sync is designed to automatically apply **budget and tROAS recommendations** generated by the smec platform. This automation helps align campaign spend with defined business goals and maximize profitability and efficiency.   + Ideally, all campaigns should receive budget recommendations from the overall goal defined in the platform.   + Budget recommendations should be applied regularly, at least **once a week**, and immediately if the overall budget changes, to ensure the changes materialize in the campaign budgets effectively. * **Meeting Prerequisites and Maintaining Operational Discipline**:    + Ensure all necessary **preconditions** for Campaign Sync are met, including linking the Google Ads account and Merchant Center, configuring a supplemental feed, and enabling relevant Campaign Orchestrator capabilities (such as performance score, overall goal, and product goals) within the smec platform.   + Maintain **operational discipline** by making structural and asset updates in the designated template campaign within the smec platform, rather than directly in Google Ads. This prevents the platform's changes from being overwritten and ensures consistency.   + Monitor the "Event Log" within the smec platform to track the status of synchronization processes and address any potential failures.   It's important to note that while there are no obvious "conceptual pitfalls" that lead to severe damage when using Campaign Sync , misconfigurations, such as setting illogical budgets or making manual changes in Google Ads that are then overwritten by the sync, can still lead to suboptimal campaign performance. |

| Short description of feature and its capabilities | **Competition Insights** is a capability within the smec platform designed to **export competitive data from Looker** for utilization with Performance Max (PMax) campaigns. Its primary function is the **configuration and scheduling of data exports** of competitive information, typically delivered to **Google Sheets**.  This data can be sourced from various marketplaces like Google Shopping, Amazon, Idealo, eBay, and Geizhals, with exports often scheduled daily. The exported insights, particularly pricing and competition data, are intended to be used for **clustering items** which then become "smec Signals" within Enhanced PMax strategies, enabling more nuanced product filtering. It's important to note that this specific feature is currently **"Deprecated"** ~~and "practically no customers" are leveraging it~~. |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | **Competition Insights** refers to a capability within the smec platform designed to **export competitive data from Looker** for utilization with Performance Max (PMax) campaigns [208, Conversation History].  **Its primary use case** involves the scheduled delivery of this competitive data, such as pricing and competitor presence from various marketplaces (e.g., Google Shopping, Amazon, Idealo, eBay, Geizhals), to **Google Sheets** [208, Conversation History]. Exports can be configured to run daily [Conversation History].  **The problem it solves** is to provide advertisers with **external market intelligence** to inform and enrich their PMax strategies, particularly addressing the "black box" nature of PMax where influencing product prioritization can be challenging. By reviewing the exported data, items can be **clustered based on competitive positioning**. ~~These clusters would then be converted into "smec Signals" that could be integrated into Enhanced PMax strategies, enabling~~ **~~more nuanced product filtering and campaign assignments~~** ~~[Conversation History].~~ |
| Who is it thought for? | Advertisers wanting to optimise their campaigns against their competitors |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | * **Availability of Competitive Data in Looker**: The core of the feature relies on the presence of competitive data within Looker, from which the insights are exported [208, 212, Conversation History]. * **Looker Admin Permissions**: Internal smec technical personnel responsible for configuring the export needed **Admin Permissions** within the Looker platform. * **Client-Specific Looker Configuration**: Each client required specific `gcp_project` and `dataset` values to be configured for their user within Looker, ensuring access to their relevant data. * **Google Sheets Integration**: A Google Drive had to be selected as the destination, implying a functional Google Sheets environment where the exported data (typically in CSV format) could be delivered. * **Defined Source Marketplaces**: It was necessary to specify the source marketplaces (e.g., Google Shopping, Amazon, Idealo, eBay, Geizhals) from which the competitive data would be collected. * **Client Product Catalog**: The client needed to have an existing product catalog (from their Merchant Center) for which the competitive data would be relevant, as the insights were intended to be linked to these catalog items. * **Performance Max Campaign Usage**: The feature was specifically designed to enrich Performance Max (PMax) campaign strategies, meaning the client would need to be using or planning to use PMax campaigns [208, Conversation History]. * **Marketing Engineering Involvement**: A crucial step involved Marketing Engineering connecting the exported spreadsheet data with the client's catalog items to make them available as "smec Signals" for Enhanced PMax strategies. |
| What options are there for its configuration? | The options for its configuration included:   * **Login to Looker**: Required access with **Admin Permissions**. * **Client User Creation**: Creating a dedicated user for the client within Looker. * **Data Source Configuration**: Setting client-specific values for `gcp_project` and `dataset` within the newly created user's settings. These values were obtained from client configuration files. * **Export Schedule Setup**: Configuring a schedule for the "Products List" Look. This involved:    + Setting the **Name** for the scheduled export (e.g., "Product List - Google Sheets - [CLIENTNAME]").   + Choosing **Google Sheets as the destination**.   + **Selecting the Google Drive** folder for delivery (typically `05. smec-Customers > Looker Exports`).   + Defining a **name for the exported file** (e.g., `Looker_CI_Export_[CLIENTNAME].csv`).   + Specifying whether to **overwrite existing files** ("Yes").   + Setting the **schedule frequency**, for instance, daily at 6 AM.   + Configuring **Advanced Options**, including setting the **Limit to "All Results"** and **Format Options to "Formatted data values"**. * **Filter Adjustments**: Reviewing and **adjusting predefined filters** as required. * **Marketplace Specification**: Entering the **Name of the Source Marketplace** (e.g., `google-shopping`, `amazon`, `idealo`, `ebay`, `geizhals`) from which data was to be collected. It was also possible to specify **excluded Competitor Marketplaces**. * **Testing and Sharing**: After configuration, a test export could be sent, and the resulting file was then shared with relevant stakeholders. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | The most crucial best practice recommendation for the **Competition Insights** feature is **not to use it**, as it is currently **"Deprecated"** and "practically no customers" are leveraging it. This indicates it is no longer supported or recommended for current operations within the smec platform.  However, in its original design, the intended best practices for leveraging Competition Insights for Performance Max (PMax) campaigns included:   * **Data-Driven Segmentation**: The primary use case was to export competitive data (e.g., pricing, competitor presence) from Looker to Google Sheets, with the aim of using this external market intelligence to **cluster items** [Conversation History]. This allowed for more nuanced product segmentation beyond just internal performance data [Conversation History]. * **Integration with PMax Strategies**: The clustered competitive data was intended to be translated into "smec Signals" [Conversation History]. These signals would then be integrated into Enhanced PMax strategies to enable **more refined product filtering and campaign assignments**, providing advertisers with a means to influence which products were prioritized within PMax, addressing its "black box" nature [5, Conversation History]. * **Regular Data Refresh**: Configuring the data exports to run at defined intervals, such as **daily at 6 AM**, was a best practice to ensure the competitive information used for strategic decisions was consistently up-to-date [Conversation History]. * **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Its effective implementation required coordination between various internal smec roles, including Solution Engineering (for initial setup and export configuration), CSMs/PMax Experts (for data review, clustering, and signal setup), and Marketing Engineering (for connecting the spreadsheet data with catalog items) [Conversation History]. |

| Short description of feature and its capabilities | The **Enhanced Event Log** is a feature within the smec platform accessible at the **Campaign Management and Segment levels**. Its primary capability is to **track communications and actions with external systems, particularly Google Ads**. It specifically monitors events such as the **start and finish of Merchant Center exports and updates to product assignments for campaigns**. This log runs typically once or twice a day, providing **status updates on whether these processes were successful**. Users can **filter the log** to view specific outcomes, and the system offers **suggestions for troubleshooting** when issues arise, such as retrying an action or contacting a CSM. However, the customer cannot manually trigger these actions themselves. |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | The **Enhanced Event Log** is a feature within the smec platform that is accessible at both the **Campaign Management and Segment levels**.  **Its primary use case** is to **track communications and actions with external systems, specifically Google Ads**. This includes monitoring specific events such as:   * The **start and finish of Merchant Center exports**. * **Updates to product assignments for campaigns**, indicating which product is assigned to which campaign.   This log typically runs **once or twice a day**, providing **status updates on whether these processes were successful or failed**. Users can **filter the log** to view specific outcomes.  **The problem it aims to solve** is providing **transparency and aiding in troubleshooting** processes that involve external systems. When an issue arises, the system offers **suggestions for troubleshooting**, such as retrying an action or contacting a Customer Success Manager (CSM). However, customers cannot manually trigger these actions themselves directly from the log. |
| Who is it thought for? | The **Enhanced Event Log** feature is primarily thought for **internal smec personnel**.  Specifically, it is designed for roles that require **transparency and troubleshooting capabilities** regarding communications and actions with external systems, particularly Google Ads |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | The **Enhanced Event Log** is designed to be used when specific preconditions related to system integration and ongoing campaign processes are met.  The preconditions for its use include:   * **Active Campaign Management and Segment Levels**: The feature is accessible and relevant at the **Campaign Management and Segment levels** within the smec platform. This implies that these structural components must be set up and active for the client. * **Integration with External Systems (Primarily Google Ads)**: The core function of the Enhanced Event Log is to **track communications and actions with external systems**, most notably **Google Ads**. Therefore, a live and functional connection between the smec platform and the client's Google Ads account is essential. * **Merchant Center Integration**: It monitors the **start and finish of Merchant Center exports**. This requires that the client's Merchant Center is connected and actively being used for product data exports via the smec platform. * **Ongoing Product Assignment and Campaign Updates**: The log specifically tracks **updates to product assignments for campaigns**. This means there must be active Performance Max (PMax) campaigns or similar campaign types where products are being assigned and updated by the smec platform. * **Processes that Generate Events**: The log provides status updates on whether these processes (like Merchant Center exports and product assignment updates) were **successful or failed**, running typically **once or twice a day**. This necessitates that these automated processes are active and periodically generating events to be logged. * **Internal smec User Access**: While users can filter the log, **customers cannot manually trigger actions** directly from it. This indicates that the feature is primarily an **internal monitoring and diagnostic tool** for smec personnel, such as Customer Success Managers (CSMs), who need to observe and troubleshoot these system interactions. |
| What options are there for its configuration? | From the perspective of a user accessing the Enhanced Event Log, the primary and seemingly **only configuration option available is to filter the log**. This allows users to narrow down the displayed events to view specific outcomes, such as only successful entries or only failed ones.  It is important to note that the event log itself is a passive reporting tool. Users cannot manually trigger actions directly from the log. The underlying processes that generate the events (e.g., Merchant Center exports, campaign syncs) have their own independent schedules and configurations within other parts of the Campaign Orchestrator module, but these are not configurations *of* the Enhanced Event Log itself. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | While the provided sources and conversation history do not contain explicit "best practice" recommendations specifically for the **Enhanced Event Log** itself, its purpose and capabilities suggest optimal ways for internal smec personnel to leverage it.  The Enhanced Event Log is primarily an internal monitoring and diagnostic tool, accessible at the Campaign Management and Segment levels, designed for roles such as Customer Success Managers (CSMs). It tracks communications and actions with external systems, particularly Google Ads, monitoring events like the start/finish of Merchant Center exports and updates to product assignments. It typically runs once or twice a day, providing status updates (successful or failed) and offering troubleshooting suggestions.  Based on its functionality, the best practices for using the Enhanced Event Log would therefore include:   * **Regular Monitoring**: Internal smec personnel, especially CSMs, should **regularly review the Enhanced Event Log** to maintain transparency over critical processes like Merchant Center exports and product assignment updates between the smec platform and Google Ads. Given it runs once or twice a day, consistent checks can help in early detection of issues. * **Proactive Troubleshooting**: When the log indicates a failed process, the best practice is to **immediately act upon the troubleshooting suggestions** provided within the log. These suggestions might include retrying an action or contacting a Customer Success Manager (CSM) for further support. * **Efficient Information Retrieval via Filtering**: To quickly identify specific outcomes or issues, users should **utilize the filtering option** available in the log. This allows narrowing down the displayed events (e.g., viewing only failed entries) to focus on actionable information. * **Internal Action Triggering**: Since customers cannot manually trigger actions directly from the log, it is a best practice for internal smec personnel to **take responsibility for initiating necessary follow-up actions** or escalating issues as suggested by the log. |

| Short description of feature and its capabilities | **Product Exclusions** serve to **prevent specific products from being advertised by smec**. This feature is configured within **Goals & Budget ‚Üí Product Goals & Exclusions**, where users can define exclusions by setting filters based on product characteristics or performance data. It operates with the **highest priority**, effectively overruling product goals and campaign management settings. Products designated for exclusion are **exempt from scoring** and are consequently removed from all active campaigns. All excluded products are then clearly marked with the **smec\_excluded custom label** for identification within Google Ads |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | The **Product Exclusions** feature in the smec platform has a clear use case and solves a specific problem for advertisers.  **Its Use Case:** The primary use case for Product Exclusions is to **prevent specific products from being advertised by smec** [Short description of feature and its capabilities for Product Exclusions]. This is configured within **Goals & Budget ‚Üí Product Goals & Exclusions**, where users can define exclusions by setting filters based on product characteristics or performance data. It operates with the **highest priority**, meaning it overrides product goals and campaign management settings. Products designated for exclusion are then **exempt from scoring** and are consequently removed from all active campaigns. All excluded products are clearly marked with the **smec\_excluded custom label** for identification within Google Ads.  This functionality is useful in scenarios where:   * A client wishes to **stop advertising certain products** that may be out of stock (e.g., if Stock Level is zero, you would exclude them) * There are **co-funding arrangements** with specific product manufacturers, leading to those products being managed or excluded elsewhere. * There's a strategic decision to **not spend ad budget on certain items** due to low margin, high return rates, or other business reasons.   **The Problems It Solves:** The Product Exclusions feature solves the problem of **unwanted or inefficient ad spend on specific products** by providing advertisers with **direct control over which products are advertised** within the smec platform. Without this feature, products imported from the Merchant Center would typically be considered for advertising. This feature addresses the challenge of manually identifying and removing such products from various campaigns or ensuring they aren't scored and pushed, streamlining the process of **managing advertising efforts in alignment with specific business objectives or inventory realities**. It prevents products that should not be advertised from being included in any campaign. |
| Who is it thought for? | The **Product Exclusions** feature is primarily thought for **advertisers** who need direct control over which products are advertised by smec. The client makes the strategic business decisions that necessitate the use of this feature, such as stopping advertising for out-of-stock items, products with co-funding arrangements, or items with low margins or high return rates |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | The **Product Exclusions** feature in the smec platform is designed to be used when specific preconditions related to product data, platform setup, and business objectives are met.  The preconditions for its use include:   * **Product Data Import**: It is a fundamental precondition that **all relevant products are imported from the Merchant Center into the smec platform**. Without products in the platform, there is nothing to exclude from advertising. * **Access within Campaign Orchestrator**: The feature is accessible and configured within the **Goals & Budget ‚Üí Product Goals & Exclusions** section of the smec platform. This implies that the Campaign Orchestrator module must be active and accessible for the client. * **Availability of Product Characteristics or Performance Data**: Users define exclusions by **setting filters based on product characteristics** (e.g., stock level, specific custom labels like `smec_excluded`) or **performance data**. Therefore, this relevant product data must be available and processed by the platform. The platform supports using various attributes for filtering, including custom labels. * **Existence of Active Campaign Management**: Product Exclusions operate with the **highest priority**, meaning they **overrule existing product goals and campaign management settings**. This implies that there must be active product goals or campaign strategies in place that would otherwise include the products intended for exclusion. * **Strategic Need for Exclusion**: The feature should be used when there is a clear business reason to **stop advertising specific products**. Common use cases include products that are out of stock (e.g., "if Stock Level is zero, you would exclude them"), products involved in co-funding arrangements, or items deemed unprofitable due to low margins or high return rates. * **User Action to Define Exclusions**: The exclusion criteria must be **manually defined and applied by the user** (client or CSM) by setting appropriate filters within the platform. While clients can operate this feature themselves, smec's Customer Success Managers (CSMs) also play a key role in its setup and support. |
| What options are there for its configuration? | The **Product Exclusions** feature offers several configuration options, primarily focused on defining precisely which products should be prevented from being advertised by smec. These configurations are managed within the platform under **Goals & Budget ‚Üí Product Goals & Exclusions**.  The available configuration options include:   * **Adding and Naming Product Exclusions**: You can **add a new product exclusion** and give it a **descriptive name** to identify its purpose. * **Defining Exclusion Filters**: The core of Product Exclusions lies in its filtering capabilities. Users can **set filters based on various product characteristics or performance data** to specify which products should be excluded. This includes, but is not limited to:    + **Product Characteristics**: Utilizing attributes such as "Stock Level" (e.g., excluding products when Stock Level is zero).   + **Custom Labels**: Applying filters based on existing custom labels from the Merchant Center. The smec platform supports managing an "infinite" number of attributes from the Merchant Center for segmentation and exclusion.   + **Performance Data**: Using performance metrics to define exclusion criteria. * **Cloning Exclusions**: Existing product exclusions can be **cloned**, which is useful for creating new exclusions with similar criteria without starting from scratch. * **Setting Schedules**: Users can **set schedules** for when a product exclusion should be active, allowing for time-bound exclusion rules. * **Managing Priority**: If multiple product exclusions are defined, their **priority can be checked and adjusted**. This is crucial as Product Exclusions operate with the highest priority, overriding product goals and campaign management settings. * **Publishing Changes**: After making any changes to product exclusions, it is necessary to **publish these changes** within both the Product Goals and Campaign Management sections for them to be considered and applied. Alternatively, changes will be applied with the next scheduled run.   Once configured and active, excluded products are marked with the `smec_excluded` custom label in Google Ads, are exempt from scoring, and are removed from all active campaigns. The client has the ability to operate this feature themselves. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | **Core Principle & Purpose:** The fundamental best practice for Product Exclusions is to use it to **strategically prevent specific products from being advertised by smec**. This is because it operates with the **highest priority**, overriding product goals and campaign management settings. Products designated for exclusion are **exempt from scoring** and are removed from all active campaigns.  **Key Recommendations for Use:**   * **Align with Business Objectives:** Product Exclusions should be used when there is a **clear business reason to stop advertising specific products**. This ensures that ad spend is focused efficiently and profitably. * **Common Use Cases:**    + **Out-of-Stock Products:** Exclude products when their **stock level is zero** to avoid advertising items that cannot be purchased.   + **Co-funding Arrangements:** Use exclusions for products managed or excluded due to **co-funding agreements** with manufacturers.   + **Unprofitable/Undesirable Products:** Implement exclusions for items that are not strategically viable for advertising, such as those with **low margins or high return rates**. * **Leverage Granular Filtering:**    + Define exclusions by setting **filters based on product characteristics** (e.g., stock level, custom labels) or performance data.   + The platform supports managing a **multitude of attributes** from the Merchant Center, allowing for highly specific exclusion criteria. * **Strategic Control vs. Full Ad Spend:** While Product Exclusions offer control, it's generally recommended to **manage as much of the advertising budget as possible within smec**. Product Exclusions are for items that *should not be advertised*, rather than a general reduction of managed items.   **Important Considerations & Warnings:**   * **Do Not Exclude All Products:** It is explicitly advised **not to exclude all products**. The feature is for targeted exclusions, not for halting all advertising. * **Careful Filter Definition:** **~~Avoid setting "bescheuert" (stupid/incorrect) filter criteria~~** ~~that might unintentionally exclude products that~~ *~~should~~* ~~be advertised~~. Always **review the product preview** to see how many products match your exclusion criteria before saving. * **Highest Priority Rule:** Remember that Product Exclusions **always overrule product goals and campaign management settings**. This means any product caught by an exclusion filter will *not* be advertised, regardless of other settings. * **Publish Changes:** After defining or modifying any product exclusions, ensure you **publish your changes** in both the Product Goals and Campaign Management sections for them to take effect. Alternatively, changes will be applied with the next scheduled run. * **Understanding Data Synchronization:** Be aware that setting up exclusions involves **processing data from the Merchant Center** and applying changes to Google Ads, which might not be immediate due to system constraints and scheduling. * **Transparency for Clients:** The client (advertiser) can **operate this feature themselves** within the platform. This empowers them with direct control. |

| Short description of feature and its capabilities | **Product Performance Insights** is a core feature within smec's Campaign Orchestrator, designed to provide **deep, granular insights into the performance of individual products and product categories**, addressing the "black box" perception of Performance Max (PMax). It offers full transparency on metrics like impressions, clicks, costs, ROAS, AOV, and the **internal product score**, allowing users to understand which products are driving value. The feature enables **longtail distribution analysis** to identify bestsellers and products needing optimization. Users can also **filter performance data by various product attributes** such as product type and brand for precise analysis. |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | **Product Performance Insights** addresses the core problem that Google's Performance Max (PMax) is "often seen as a black box," making it challenging for advertisers to discern which specific products are genuinely driving value and contributing to profit. This lack of granular visibility prevents them from effectively allocating ad spend and optimizing their campaigns.  The feature's primary use case is to provide **deep, actionable insights into the performance of individual products and product categories**. It allows advertisers to precisely track key metrics such as impressions, clicks, costs, Return On Ad Spend (ROAS), Average Order Value (AOV), and the internal product score for each product. This transparency enables users to understand longtail distribution, identify bestsellers, and pinpoint products needing optimization, ultimately helping them to **focus ad spend on high-margin, high-impact products and increase overall efficiency and profitability**. |
| Who is it thought for? |  |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | **Product Performance Insights** is designed to provide deep, granular insights into product performance within Performance Max (PMax) campaigns, solving the problem that PMax is often perceived as a "black box".  For this feature to be effectively used and provide its insights, several preconditions must be met, primarily revolving around data integration and the underlying product scoring mechanism:   * **Platform Setup and Inventory Scoring:** The foundational step for using Product Performance Insights is the proper setup of the smec platform itself and the **Inventory Scoring capability**. This capability is crucial as it assigns a unique score to each product based on smec's "tree-based" algorithm, which is then combined with product goals to create the "orchestrator score". The insights feature provides transparency on this internal product scoring and its development over time. * **Data Availability and Access:**    + **Google Merchant Center:** The system requires a user with access to the Google Merchant Center account, ensuring that product information can be fetched. Products must be submitted through a feed with the correct two-letter CLDR country code.   + **Google Ads Performance Data:** Access to the Google Ads account is necessary to obtain item-level performance data, which is a key component of the product score calculation and the insights provided.   + **Configured Overall Goal & Budget:** For the orchestrator score to be calculated and recommendations to be generated, a non-"documentation only" overall goal and budget must be set within the platform. Product goals also need to be enabled and configured.   + **Optional: Microsoft Ads Data Integration:** If insights are desired for Microsoft PMax campaigns, the collection of Microsoft Ads performance data needs to be specifically requested, allowing for the inclusion of this data in the performance score calculation.   In essence, Product Performance Insights leverages the comprehensive data gathered and processed by the Campaign Orchestrator, particularly through its sophisticated product scoring, to deliver actionable transparency to advertisers and PPC Managers. |
| What options are there for its configuration? | **Product Performance Insights** is a feature designed to offer granular visibility into product performance, addressing the "black box" nature of Performance Max (PMax) campaigns. While Product Performance Insights primarily acts as a **reporting and visualization tool**, its "configuration" largely pertains to the setup and fine-tuning of the underlying **Product Scoring (also known as Inventory Scoring)** mechanism, which generates the data displayed within the insights.  The configuration options for this underlying product scoring and the display of insights include:   * **Core Product Scoring Setup (Primarily by Solution Engineers):** * **Enabling and Scheduling Score Calculation:** Defining whether the performance score calculation is active and setting its frequency, typically every midnight, to ensure up-to-date insights. * **Data Source Selection:** Specifying which performance data the score calculation should consider, including inventory data, Google Ads performance data (item-level), and, optionally, Microsoft Ads performance data. * **Market and Language Definition:** Setting the target market and language for which the scoring data is created and filtered. * **Weighting of Performance Factors (Tree-Based Approach):** Solution Engineers can adjust the "golden dots" within the tree-based scoring algorithm. This allows them to define the **contribution "weights" of different performance aspects**, such as ROAS, conversions, clicks, and impressions. For instance, for clients targeting CPA, the "converted score" can be adjusted so conversions have a higher weight than ROAS. * **Handling of New and Low-Data Products:** The system can be configured to assign a **high initial score to new products** to give them a chance to perform, with this score gradually fading over a configurable period. It can also incorporate the performance of "peer products" (those with similar brands or categories) when a product lacks sufficient individual data. * **Influencing the Orchestrator Score (via Product Goals):**    + While clients generally cannot directly modify the core scoring algorithm, they can leverage **Product Goals** to influence the "Orchestrator Score" (which is the Inventory Score combined with Product Goals). By assigning an "advertising mode" (e.g., Aggressive, Conservative) to a group of products based on their strategic importance or other characteristics, clients can effectively modify their internal score and influence their placement in campaigns. * **Display and Analysis of Insights (Filtering and Viewing):** * **Granular Filtering:** Users can **filter and drill down into performance data** from the perspective of individual products or product categories using various attributes such as product type, brand, and custom labels. The system supports distinguishing between `Product Brand` and `Retailer Brand` for precise analysis. * **Cluster Percentiles:** Users can experiment with different "splits" in the insights by changing the "Cluster Percentile" filter (e.g., "0.3,0.6,1.0"). This allows them to **group products into different performance clusters** (like High, Mid, Low score) to better understand their distribution and performance characteristics.   It is important to note that the **core product scoring configuration is complex and primarily managed by smec's Solution Engineers**, not directly by the end-client. Clients primarily interact with Product Performance Insights by viewing the generated data and utilizing its filtering capabilities for analysis. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | **Product Performance Insights** empowers advertisers and PPC managers to move beyond the "black box" perception of Performance Max (PMax) by providing granular data on individual product and category performance. The best practices for leveraging this feature revolve around both **interpreting the insights** and **optimizing your advertising strategy** based on the data provided, often in conjunction with underlying Product Scoring configurations.   1. **Leveraging Product Performance Insights for Analysis:**  * **Deep Dive into Cluster Performance**: Utilize the detailed insights to understand the performance of products grouped into different "clusters" (e.g., High, Mid, Low score).    + **Compare ROAS vs. Average ROAS (Avg)**: Ideally, these metrics should be close within a cluster.   + If **ROAS (Avg) << ROAS**, it indicates an imbalance with many low-performing products, suggesting that the cluster might need to be split to isolate these products into a separate campaign.   + If **ROAS (Avg) >> ROAS**, it points to extreme high-performing products skewing the average, indicating a potential need to split the cluster to give these high-value products their own campaign.   + **Analyze ROAS between Consecutive Clusters**: If the ROAS difference between two clusters (e.g., Mid and Low) is not significant, it's recommended to combine them to simplify campaign structure and allow Google's AI more data.   + **Address Products with No Conversions in High-Priority Clusters**: If many products in your highest-priority cluster have no conversions, it could be due to:   + **Excessive randomization** in the scoring; consider increasing the boost of the "Converted Score" in the underlying configuration.   + **High churn in the product feed or small cluster size**, leading new products (which initially get a high score) to dominate the cluster. In such cases, disabling the `recency_score` might be an option. * **Utilize Granular Filtering**: Product Performance Insights allows you to filter and drill down into data by various product attributes like product type, brand, and custom labels, enabling precise analysis. This allows you to differentiate between `Product Brand` and `Retailer Brand` for more accurate insights.  2. **Optimizing Campaigns based on Insights:**  * **Strategic Product Allocation**: Based on the performance insights, allocate products across campaigns following a "tree-based split" logic. For a standard 3-way split (High, Mid, Low):    + **Low Score Campaigns**: Should contain a maximum of 40% of your products.   + **Mid Score Campaigns**: Should cover around 50-55% of products, typically serving as the largest segment.   + **High Score Campaigns**: Should focus on a smaller, high-impact segment of 5-10% of products. * **Calibrate tROAS and Budget Settings**: Use the insights to inform your target ROAS (tROAS) and budget settings for each campaign.    + ~~If your client's ROAS goal is within +/- 10% of the account's actual average ROAS (over the last 30-90 days), set tROAS goals directly according to the client's goal.~~   + If the client's goal deviates more than 10%, it's often more effective to set initial tROAS goals closer to the account's actual average ROAS and gradually increase them over time.   + The platform generally recommends a **lower tROAS for high-score campaigns** (e.g., `Overall ROAS Goal * 0.95`) to push the highest-scored products and maximize conversion value, while **higher tROAS for low-score campaigns** (e.g., `Overall ROAS Goal * 1.05`) aims to cut back costs and increase efficiency. * **Influence Product Pushing with Product Goals**: For products with strategic importance (e.g., high margin, low return), use **Product Goals** and assign an "Aggressive," "MoreAggressive," or "SuperAggressive" advertising mode. This directly modifies their internal product score, making them more likely to be pushed into higher-priority campaigns, driving incremental sales beyond just bestsellers. * **Implement Product Exclusions**: Utilize Product Exclusions (configured within Product Goals & Exclusions) to prevent certain products from being advertised by smec. This is particularly useful for **products with zero stock levels** or those that are out-of-season, ensuring ad spend is not wasted. Excluded products receive a `smec_excluded` custom label in Google Ads for easy filtering.  3. **Considerations for Underlying Scoring Configuration (Typically by Solution Engineers):**  * **Tailored Scoring Algorithm**: While clients don't directly configure the "tree-based" scoring algorithm, it's a best practice for Solution Engineers to adjust the "golden dots" (contribution weights of performance aspects like ROAS, conversions, clicks, impressions) to align with specific client goals, such as targeting CPA by weighting conversions higher than ROAS. * **Black Friday/Seasonal Adjustments**: During sales events like Black Friday, the scoring configuration can be temporarily adjusted. For instance, you can:    + Increase the "boost" for converted products and re-weight ROAS over conversions to maintain organic top-sellers.   + Adjust `days_with_conversions` to minimize the impact of the short sales period on long-term product scores.   + Consider the `days_since_last_conversion` for frequently changing assortments to prioritize recently sold items. * **Leverage Extended Product Attributes**: The platform can import and utilize virtually "infinite" product attributes beyond Google's standard custom labels for segmentation and exclusion, allowing for highly sophisticated and relevant product targeting.   By applying these practices, Product Performance Insights facilitates more informed decision-making, leading to increased efficiency, profitability, and clarity in Performance Max campaigns. |

| Short description of feature and its capabilities | The **Settings History**, also referred to as the Changelog, offers a comprehensive overview of modifications made within the platform's Campaign Management, Budget Goals, and Product Goals. It records **who made a change, when, and what specific alterations were implemented**, such as status changes or value adjustments. This feature ensures **full transparency by making all internal configurations and their historical changes visible to the client**, similar to Google Ads' own change history but focused on platform-specific settings. It helps in understanding the evolution of a setup over time and what changes were applied by whom within the system. |
| What is its use case? What problem does it solve? | The **Settings History**, also known as the Changelog, directly addresses the common pain point of PPC managers who struggle with a **lack of control and visibility** within Google Performance Max campaigns, often perceiving the system as a "black box". Its primary use case is to provide **full transparency and traceability** into all internal configurations and their historical changes within the platform's Campaign Management, Budget Goals, and Product Goals capabilities. The feature precisely records **who made a change, when they made it, and what specific alterations were implemented**, such as a status changing from "inactive to active" or adjustments to specific configuration values. By offering a comprehensive historical record, it allows users to clearly understand the **evolution of their setup over time** and effectively trace back any modifications applied by personnel within the system. |
| Who is it thought for? |  |
| What are the preconditions it can / should be used? | The **Settings History**, also known as the Changelog, is an intrinsic feature of the platform designed to provide transparency and traceability for changes made to specific configurations. It automatically records modifications, including "who made a change, when, and what specific alterations were implemented".  Therefore, the primary precondition for the Settings History to be **used effectively and contain relevant data** is the **active setup and ongoing modification of the platform's core advertising management capabilities**. Specifically, these capabilities include:   * **Campaign Management**: The history will track any alterations made within the campaign management section, which is responsible for defining and synchronizing campaign settings, asset groups, and listing groups with Google Ads. * **Budget Goals**: Changes to overall budget and goal settings, which inform the platform's recommendations and campaign orchestration, are recorded in the history. * **Product Goals**: Modifications to product goals, including their enabling, definition, and advertising modes, are also tracked.   In essence, the Settings History does not require a separate activation; it functions as a **built-in auditing tool** that automatically populates with data as soon as any user or system-driven changes occur within these designated areas of the platform. |
| What options are there for its configuration? | The **Settings History**, also known as the Changelog, is designed as an **intrinsic auditing tool** within the platform, automatically recording modifications made to certain key capabilities. As such, there are **no direct configuration options for the Settings History itself** to control what it logs or how it presents information.  Instead, the Settings History passively and automatically populates with data whenever changes occur within the following designated areas of the platform:   * **Campaign Management**: Any alterations to campaign settings, asset groups, or listing groups are logged. * **Budget Goals**: Modifications to overall budget and goal settings are recorded. * **Product Goals**: Changes to product goals, their enabling, definitions, or advertising modes are tracked.   The feature precisely records **who made a change, when it was made, and what specific alterations were implemented**, such as a status being changed from "inactive to active" or adjustments to specific configuration values. This ensures full transparency by making all internal configurations and their historical changes visible. The content of the Settings History is a direct reflection of user and system actions within these core capabilities, functioning as a comprehensive historical record rather than a configurable feature itself. |
| Recommendation for best practice. | While the **Settings History** (Changelog) itself has **no direct configuration options** and functions as an intrinsic auditing tool, its best practice lies in its proactive utilization for **transparency, troubleshooting, and oversight** [conversation].  Here are key recommendations for its effective use:   * **Regular Monitoring for Transparency and Audit**: It is highly recommended to **constantly monitor the Settings History** to review client-initiated changes, such as adjustments to tROAS, budget, or product-level modifications. This allows for **full transparency** into all internal configurations and their historical changes, making visible "who made a change, when, and what specific alterations were implemented". * **Troubleshooting and Problem Identification**: When unexpected campaign performance shifts occur, the Settings History serves as a crucial tool to **trace back modifications** made within Campaign Management, Budget Goals, or Product Goals. By examining the chronological record of changes, users can quickly identify if a recent configuration alteration is contributing to the observed performance. * **Understanding Setup Evolution**: Leverage the Settings History to gain an understanding of how campaign setups and goals have evolved over time. This is particularly valuable for onboarding new team members or when conducting periodic performance reviews to grasp the context behind current configurations. |

Introduction This how-to guide provides a detailed description of the steps that are necessary to pitch, set up and manage PMax campaigns that use page feeds in the context of the Campaign Orchestrator. 

* The **focus of this guide is on existing clients** where we want to drive wallet share expansion. Therefore, we assume that the client already has an active contract with us when we start the up-selling process.
* For **new clients, the PMax page feed approach is currently only teased** in the solution playbook. This is an outlook of what to expect after the onboarding phase.

 **Why do we focus on existing clients?** 

* **Performance leverage and MRR uplift**: Due to the separated steering of Shopping and Non-shopping traffic, the Page Feed approach can lead to a performance uplift and ultimately also to an adspend and therefore MRR uplift.
* **Early-stage product development:** As we are still in the very early stages of developing this new feature, we are leveraging our existing client base (and the relation we have to friendly clients) to build a more streamlined and scalable way to set up and deliver our approach.
* **Churn prevention for Search Ad Automation:** With this approach, we have a valid offer for replacing Search Ad Automation for clients where we are experiencing performance issues. Page Feed Logic The plan with Page Feeds is the following: we want to split PMax Shopping and PMax Non-shopping due to: 

* Performance differences between Shopping and Non-Shopping
* and therefore more granular/separated steering of those
* leading to more push-possibility in terms of ROAS aggressivity ‚Üí MRR uplift
* Also, ‚Äòclassic‚Äô Search campaigns/DSAs might get outdated therefore PMax for Asset-only (Page Feeds) can make sense

* **Option 1** (Base Setup): Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs are taken into consideration
* **Option 2** (Extended Setup): Product URLs + Custom Attribute URLs are taken into consideration (+ optional: Landing Page Report URLs)

Which Setup Option to choose? [Setup Option 1 (Base Setup)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYfU7iaKT4krBzgZp9Vhxn7cvhQsr6EfThD385-FTds/edit?slide=id.g33a6febc460_0_0#slide=id.g33a6febc460_0_0) is the preferred one because of less effort on ME side and little effort on client side. Also, due to the fact that also the landing page report is taken a URL source, the probability that all relevant URLs are covered within this Base Setup is high, so Setup Option 2 (Extended Setup) might be for many clients too-over engineered.  [Setup Option 2 (Extended Setup)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYfU7iaKT4krBzgZp9Vhxn7cvhQsr6EfThD385-FTds/edit?slide=id.g3519ca496bd_0_0#slide=id.g3519ca496bd_0_0) means more effort on ME and on client side. The client has to be able to provide all wished URLs within Custom Attributes. What we‚Äôve seen so far is that many clients are struggling with this and therefore the go live date gets postponed or even cancelled because in the meantime more important projects appear.

  1.) Requirement CheckFit Evaluation (Client CSM/PMM) First of all, check if the client fulfils the requirements for a Page Feed logic. The following has to be given:  ‚ö†Ô∏è Account or country (if multiple countries in one account) must have **at least 100 non-brand, non-shopping conversions** on a monthly basis.  To find this out, sum up all non-brand, non-shopping conversions you find in: 

* **Search/DSA campaigns** 
  + If dedicated brand and non-brand search campaigns existing: only consider non-brand campaign
  + If brand and non-brand traffic is mixed within one/multiple campaigns: make sure to filter only for non-branded conversions (e.g. through search term report)
* **PMax campaigns (non-branded)** 
  + If currently one asset-only campaign: take all those conversions into consideration
  + If currently full-funnel: check non-shopping share via platform insights (or Mike Rhodes script if no platform yet in use) and sum up all non-shopping conversions 
    - Image "image-20250512-140135.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1346797578/image-20250512-140135.png?api=v2
  + If currently shopping-only: do not consider those conversions

 **üî¥ Negative Evaluation Result**  If, after this check, less than 100 non-branded, non-shopping conversions are generated on a monthly basis, Page Feeds are not a fit yet because we would have to conversion data for (at least) 3 campaigns (HI, LO, Exploration). Instead, consider a ‚Äòless advanced‚Äô shopping and non-shopping PMax campaign split like for example: 

* 3 Campaign Orchestrator campaigns (HI, ME, LO) shopping-only; make sure to still have enough conversions per campaign when switching to shopping-only. If this is not the case, do not split it!
* 1 ‚Äònormal‚Äô asset-only campaign

 Make sure to bill the Asset-only campaign if possible  As soon as the requirements are fulfilled and enough conversions are being generated, the upgrade from one ‚Äònormal‚Äô Asset-only campaign to Page Feed campaigns can be considered.  üü¢ **Positive Evaluation Result**  If at least 100 non-brand, non-shopping conversions are generated on a monthly basis, you can proceed with the next step. 2.)

| Dr. Nutrition AE (EN) | **Search**: Mixed campaigns (Brand & Non-brand)  **PMax**: Full funnel no Brand exclusion  ‚ö†Ô∏è For such cases: do not separate Brand at first to not have too many changes at once. Also, MRR would be lower due to Brand potentially not billed by smec (due to separation). | <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZiT4aQdseKqoWhebjE--W0VBw2sEea-EDyqPaWavXkU/edit?slide=id.g3079322f713_0_63#slide=id.g3079322f713_0_63> | What to consider for perfect campaign proposalBrand Treatment For majority of the cases, Branded traffic is already been separated, meaning: dedicated Search campaign is existing and smec PMax campaigns have Brand excluded. If this is the case, also exclude Brand from Page Feed campaigns.  If, such as for Dr. Nutrition (see table above), Brand is not being treated separately, do not separate it when starting with Page Feeds. Why: would result it too many changes at once, to little conversions for the Page Feed campaigns and less MRR (if this Brand traffic is not being billed by smec). Number of Page Feed campaigns The number of Page Feed campaigns depends on the current amount of Non-Brand and Non-shopping conversions per month, identified in [Step 1 (Fit Evaluation)](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/1346797578/How+To+Setup+and+manage+PMax+campaigns+with+page+feeds#Fit-Evaluation-(Client-CSM/PMM)):  | **Number of Non-Brand and Non-Shopping Conversions per Month** | **Number of campaigns** | **Campaigns** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 - 300 | 3 | High, Low, Exploration |
| 300+ - 600 | 4 | High, Medium, Low, Exploration |
| 600+ | 5 | Super High, High, Medium, Low, Exploration | If more than one account existing - where to launch Page Feed campaigns? The Page Feeds will be generated in the account which is linked to the smec platform. Therefore, the Page Feed campaigns should also be launched in this account. Playbook Pitch (Team + Page Feed CSM) Client Team (+ Page Feed CSM) pitches the Page Feed concept to the client.  How to pitch - Recordings: 

* DE Recording | DocCheck <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PfyDDVWAQvs_9ML9DbaUzis4mkGZ6Ov5/view>

3.) Contracting Phase (Teamlead/Account Executive)

* **Usage Fee as driver for share of wallet expansion** MANDATORY  It is necessary to establish the commercial basis for share of wallet expansion. This means that we need a contract that applies a **usage fee to PMax** campaigns managed or generated by smec (e.g. Campaign Orchestrator, smec Ad Automation Suite, ...). 
  + If the contract basis does not cover the usage fee on PMax, it is recommended to migrate the client to our new offering.
  + If a migration to a PMax-covering contract is not possible, contact [Christian Scharm√ºller](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/people/60dde34c7536500070bd2160?ref=confluence).
* **Setup / One-off** 
  + **Option 1 (Base Setup)** 
    - Requires a minimum incremental spend of ca. 5.000‚Ç¨ per month (assuming setup efforts of 8h maximum) in order to offer a setup free of charge. However, if possible, charge 2.080‚Ç¨ setup fee also if incremental spend of ca. 5.000‚Ç¨ is given.
    - If required minimum incremental spend of ca. 5.000‚Ç¨ per month is not given, 2.080‚Ç¨ setup fee has to be billed (= 8x hourly rate of 260‚Ç¨)
  + **Option 2 (Extended Setup)** 
    - Workload on ME side varies from case to case. Therefore align with ME how many hours of setup should be billed.

4.) Setup PhaseBusiness Logic Definition (Page Feed CSM/PMM)a) Setup Type Define which setup type should be implemented. 

* **Option 1** (Base Setup): Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs
* **Option 2** (Extended Setup): Product URLs + Custom Attribute URLs
* **Other** (e.g. mix): Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs + Custom Attribute URLs

b) Performance Thresholds Define which thresholds should be used for assigning URLs to HI, ME or LO Page Feed. Thresholds have to be defined per Page Feed (HI, ME, LO) and per URL Type (Product URLs, Landing Page Report URLs, Custom Attribute URLs). Google Ads metrics work for all URL types as the threshold. For Product URLs, also the Orchestrator score can be taken as the threshold.  **Example 1**: all URLs/URL Types should have a Google Ads Metric as thresholds, e.g. ROAS: 

* HI: ROAS above 4
* ME: ROAS between 2,5 and 4
* LO: below 2,5

 **Example 2**: Product URLs should have Orchestrator Score as the threshold (always indicate the percentiles!), all other URLs should have Google Ads metric as threshold: 

* High Page Feed: 
  + Product URLs: Orchestrator Score HI (100-80)
  + Landing Page Report URLs: ROAS above 4
  + Custom Attribute URLs: ROAS above 4
* Medium Page Feed: 
  + Product URLs: Orchestrator Score ME (60-80)
  + Landing Page Report URLs: ROAS between 2,5 and 4
  + Custom Attribute URLs: ROAS between 2,5 and 4
* Low Page Feed: 
  + Product URLs: Orchestrator Score LO (0-60)
  + Landing Page Report URLs: ROAS below 2,5
  + Custom Attribute URLs: ROAS below 2,5

c) Asset Group Logic Within the Page Feed campaigns you will have a regular Asset Group structure containing all assets. Therefore you need to define which Asset Group Logic each URL type will have.  **Example Option 1 (Base Setup):**  | **URL Type** | **Asset Group Logic** |
| --- | --- |
| * Product URLs * Landing Page Report URLs | **Product URLs:** should get **Product Type 1** as Asset Group Tag, which is e.g. *Shoes* (or Brand *Adidas Terrex* from MC Brand column)  **Landing Page Report URLs**: should get ‚Äò**Rest**‚Äô |
| This will result in the following Asset Groups:   * X Asset Groups based on **Product Type 1** (depends on how many Product Types the client has)    + Also possible: ‚Äòdedicated Asset Groups for PT *A, B* and *C*, rest should be one Asset Group *Rest Product Types* * 1 Asset Group ***Rest*** | |  **Landing Page Report URLs** will be a mix of category URLs, brand URLs etc. Therefore it‚Äôs not possible to define Product Type 1 as the Asset Group Tag for those URLs. Example: URL <https://www.engelhorn.de/de-de/herren/marken/a/adidas-terrex/> can‚Äôt get Product Type 1 assigned because this brand does not only have *Shoes* but also *Jackets*, *Gloves*, etc. as Product Type 1. Therefore, Landing Page Report URLs will all get the same tag which is e.g. ‚ÄòRest‚Äô.    **Example Option 2 (Extended Setup):**  | **URL Type** | **Asset Group Logic** |
| --- | --- |
| * Product URLs * Custom Attribute URLs    + Gender URL   + Shape URL   + Frame Color   + Material URL | **Product URLs**: should get **Product Type 1** as Asset Group Tag, which is e.g. *Shoes* (or Brand *Adidas Terrex* from MC Brand column)  **Custom Attribute URLs** will get the column naming as the Asset Group Tag:   * Gender URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòGender‚Äô * Shape URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòShape‚Äô * Frame Color URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòFrame color‚Äô * Material URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòMaterial‚Äô |
| This will result in:   * X Asset Groups based on **Product Type 1** (depends on how many Product Types the client has)    + Also possible: ‚Äòdedicated Asset Groups for PT *A, B* and *C*, rest should be one Asset Group *Rest Product Types* * 1 Asset Group ***Gender*** * 1 Asset Group ***Shape*** * 1 Asset Group ***Frame color*** * 1 Asset Group ***Material*** | | d) Link to Platform Page Feeds will be linked to an existing Platform Scope of the client. Why: the generated Page Feeds will be available in Google Ads through the Platform connection. This means: the account with the connection to the smec Platform is also the one where Page Feed campaigns should be launched.  Theoretically it is also possible to create a new Scope and link another account, e.g. account *B,* so that Page Feeds and Page Feed Campaigns get generated in this second account. BUT: this other account should contain Product URL performance and Landing Page Report URL performance. Otherwise no data for threshold calculation is available.

### Content
IntroductionWhat is the purpose of this How To guide? This How To guide should give guidance for setups where Microsoft PMax should be setup as part of the campaign orchestrator. It focuses on the setup of the campaign orchestrator and is complementary to the general Microsoft Advertising user guide: <https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/x/aIT5Cg>.  Please note that this guide in general assumes that the campaign orchestrator is already setup for Google PMax or will be setup in parallel. In case that this is not the case and the setup should be done entirely only for MS PMax, this how to guide should still be helpful. Prerequisites There are currently some prerequisites for setting up Microsoft PMax campaigns with the campaign orchestrator: 

* The Google Merchant Center is used for Microsoft Ads (see: [Import your Google Merchant Center product offers to Microsoft Merchant Center](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56870/1))\*
* Depending on the setup design, it might be necessary to have a second custom label available (see [Setup Design](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399983780/How+To+Setup+Microsoft+PMax+Campaigns+as+part+of+the+Campaign+Orchestrator#Setup-Design))

 \* See also the following FAQ: [What should I do in the case that my client does not use the import from the Google Merchant Center to the Microsoft Merchant Center?](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980072/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#What-should-I-do-in-the-case-that-my-client-does-not-use-the-import-from-the-Google-Merchant-Center-to-the-Microsoft-Merchant-Center%3F) Setup Overview The setup of the Campaign Orchestrator for Microsoft PMax campaigns consists of two main parts: 

* Calculation of the performance score
* Populating the custom label in the merchant center

 The creation of the campaigns in Microsoft Ads is currently not supported by the campaign orchestrator in an automated way, therefore, this needs to be done manually. Setup Design The calculation of the performance score can be approached in different ways, and the decision which approach is taken also influences the way how the custom label is populated to the merchant center.  Basically, this boils down to the following two decisions: 

1. Which data should be considered?
2. Should the MS PMax score be different or the same to the one of Google PMax?

 Each of these decisions will have different effects on the setup design and the advantages & disadvantages should be considered carefully.  | **Decision 1:** Which data should be considered? | **Decision 2:** Should the MS PMax score be different or the same to the one of Google PMax? | **Advantages & Disadvantages** |

Step 1: Decide on the setup design (Who: SE, with CL/CSM/CEM) In case no corresponding solution engineering case exists already, please request support from solution engineering via: <https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/SEC/form/47>  The first step in the setup process is to decide which setup design to use. More specifically, the following two decisions need to be taken: 

1. Which data should be considered? (Google, MS or Google + MS)
2. Should the MS PMax score be different or the same to the one of Google PMax? (Yes or No)

Step 2: Calculation of performance score & export into MC This step is different based on the setup design, therefore, it is split up based on the setup design: 

* Option Image "(blue star)" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-940443821/6452/2ee1c5d9efe54750278c6f69686b9b6ea3bed6bf/\_/images/icons/emoticons/72/31-20e3.png: It was decided that MS PMax and Google Ads will use the same score
* Option Image "(blue star)" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-940443821/6452/2ee1c5d9efe54750278c6f69686b9b6ea3bed6bf/\_/images/icons/emoticons/72/32-20e3.png: It was decided that the MS PMax score should be different to the one of Google PMax

Step 2 - Option Image "(blue star)" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-940443821/6452/2ee1c5d9efe54750278c6f69686b9b6ea3bed6bf/\_/images/icons/emoticons/72/31-20e3.png: Same score for MS PMax & Google PMax (Who: CSM + SE) For the case that you decided that you will use the score, which is already being calculated for Google PMax, you can skip this step and move directly to Step 3 (see examples below).  Image https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/images/icons/grey\_arrow\_down.pngExample  Example 1 - :google:: You will reuse the existing score, which is already being calculated for Google PMax orchestrator campaigns, which is based solely on Google data  In case it was decided that the score should be the same for Google PMax and Microsoft PMax, but the data which is considered should be different than the one which is already considered for Google PMax, the performance score needs to be changed.  Image https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/images/icons/grey\_arrow\_down.pngExample  Example 1 - :google: + :Microsoft\_Ads:: You will adapt the existing score, which is already being calculated for Google PMax orchestrator campaigns, to now include not just data from Google Ads, but also data from Microsoft Ads Step 2.1 - Option Image "(blue star)" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-940443821/6452/2ee1c5d9efe54750278c6f69686b9b6ea3bed6bf/\_/images/icons/emoticons/72/31-20e3.png: Collection of MS Ads performance data (Who: CSM) In the case that MS Ads data should be included in the score, the collection of MS Ads data needs to be requested. For this, use the following form <https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PSC/form/57> and fill it out as following: 

* **Summary**: The title of the Jira ticket, should follow the naming convention: `<client name> - <target country> - MS Ads Performance Data Collection`, for example: `Smarter Ecommerce GmbH - AT - MS Ads Performance Data Collection`
* **Client/Account Name**: As defined in the platform
* **Link to platform**: URL to the platform scope
* **Features**: You can choose ‚ÄúPerformance Insights‚Äù
* **MCC**: Can be left empty, as it is only applicable for Google setups
* **Google Ads Account ID**: Can be left empty, as it is only applicable for Google setups
* **Microsoft Account ID**: The ID of the Microsoft Ads Account, which can be found in the URL: Image "image-20240808-140030.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399983780/image-20240808-140030.png?api=v2
* **Due date**: approx. 3 days

Step 2.2 - Option Image "(blue star)" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-940443821/6452/2ee1c5d9efe54750278c6f69686b9b6ea3bed6bf/\_/images/icons/emoticons/72/31-20e3.png: Configuration of performance score (Who: SE) For this, navigate to: *Inventory Scoring > Settings* and change settings for *Ad Platforms* to match your decision. Image "image-20240808-133907.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399983780/image-20240808-133907.png?api=v2 It is highly recommend to directly *Calculate Score* (*Inventory Scoring > Performance Score*) and to then compare the newly calculated score based on the new setting with the previous score. This can be done by navigating to *Inventory Scoring > Insights*.  After this step is done, the export into the merchant center should be done automatically via the existing campaign management setup for Google PMax, as the import from the Google Merchant Center to the Microsoft Merchant Center will sync the data into the Microsoft Merchant Center. Step 2 - Option Image "(blue star)" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-940443821/6452/2ee1c5d9efe54750278c6f69686b9b6ea3bed6bf/\_/images/icons/emoticons/72/32-20e3.png: Different score for MS PMax & Google PMax (Who: CSM/CEM) In case it was decided that the score should be different for Google PMax and Microsoft PMax, the setup of a new scope and performance score needs to be requested. For this the process is generally the same as for Google PMax, therefore, please refer to the following guide: [https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/614858753/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-the-Campaign-Orchestrator](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980072/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-the-Campaign-Orchestrator).  Please note however the following important aspects when setting up the campaign orchestrator solely for MS Ads: 

* The name of the scope should reflect the fact that it is done for Microsoft Ads
* The setup of the performance score should be done in accordance with the setup design (Which data should be considered? - Google, MS or Google + MS)
* MS Ads will not be mentioned in the UI within the campaign configuration, as the platform was for now only built for Google Ads and is basically being ‚Äúmisused‚Äù for this case 
  + The campaign sync, therefore, cannot be used for this setup
  + The recommendations will not be useful, but the orchestrator score can still be used for this setup
* In case that you want to ‚Äúhide‚Äù this scope from your client, you will need to request to have this scope setup within a different account in the platform, as it is only possible to set up permissions on account level, not on scope level

Step 3: Setup of campaigns in MS Ads After the performance score is calculated and written into the Merchant Center via the campaign management, the performance score can be used in MS Ads. It is possible that a different campaign structure is used for MS Ads than for Google Ads, but still use the same score. This can be done by combining several custom label values within the listing groups of one campaign in MS Ads. The following table shows a simplified example:  | **Campaign Setup in Google Ads** | **Campaign Setup in Microsoft Ads** |
| --- | --- |
| Campaign ‚ÄúHigh Score‚Äù   * Listing group filter: `Custom Label 1 = High Score` | Campaign ‚ÄúHigh Score‚Äù   * Listing group filter: `Custom Label 1 = High Score` |
| Campaign ‚ÄúMid Score‚Äù   * Listing group filter: `Custom Label 1 = Mid Score` | Campaign ‚ÄúLow Score‚Äù   * Listing group filter: `Custom Label 1 = Mid Score OR Custom Label 1 = Low Score` |
| Campaign ‚ÄúLow Score‚Äù   * Listing group filter: `Custom Label 1 = Low Score` |  |

Introduction This how-to guide provides a detailed description of the steps that are necessary to pitch, set up and manage PMax campaigns that use page feeds in the context of the Campaign Orchestrator. 

* The **focus of this guide is on existing clients** where we want to drive wallet share expansion. Therefore, we assume that the client already has an active contract with us when we start the up-selling process.
* For **new clients, the PMax page feed approach is currently only teased** in the solution playbook. This is an outlook of what to expect after the onboarding phase.

 **Why do we focus on existing clients?** 

* **Performance leverage and MRR uplift**: Due to the separated steering of Shopping and Non-shopping traffic, the Page Feed approach can lead to a performance uplift and ultimately also to an adspend and therefore MRR uplift.
* **Early-stage product development:** As we are still in the very early stages of developing this new feature, we are leveraging our existing client base (and the relation we have to friendly clients) to build a more streamlined and scalable way to set up and deliver our approach.
* **Churn prevention for Search Ad Automation:** With this approach, we have a valid offer for replacing Search Ad Automation for clients where we are experiencing performance issues. Page Feed Logic The plan with Page Feeds is the following: we want to split PMax Shopping and PMax Non-shopping due to: 

* Performance differences between Shopping and Non-Shopping
* and therefore more granular/separated steering of those
* leading to more push-possibility in terms of ROAS aggressivity ‚Üí MRR uplift
* Also, ‚Äòclassic‚Äô Search campaigns/DSAs might get outdated therefore PMax for Asset-only (Page Feeds) can make sense

* **Option 1** (Base Setup): Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs are taken into consideration
* **Option 2** (Extended Setup): Product URLs + Custom Attribute URLs are taken into consideration (+ optional: Landing Page Report URLs)

Which Setup Option to choose? [Setup Option 1 (Base Setup)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYfU7iaKT4krBzgZp9Vhxn7cvhQsr6EfThD385-FTds/edit?slide=id.g33a6febc460_0_0#slide=id.g33a6febc460_0_0) is the preferred one because of less effort on ME side and little effort on client side. Also, due to the fact that also the landing page report is taken a URL source, the probability that all relevant URLs are covered within this Base Setup is high, so Setup Option 2 (Extended Setup) might be for many clients too-over engineered.  [Setup Option 2 (Extended Setup)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYfU7iaKT4krBzgZp9Vhxn7cvhQsr6EfThD385-FTds/edit?slide=id.g3519ca496bd_0_0#slide=id.g3519ca496bd_0_0) means more effort on ME and on client side. The client has to be able to provide all wished URLs within Custom Attributes. What we‚Äôve seen so far is that many clients are struggling with this and therefore the go live date gets postponed or even cancelled because in the meantime more important projects appear.

  1.) Requirement CheckFit Evaluation (Client CSM/PMM) First of all, check if the client fulfils the requirements for a Page Feed logic. The following has to be given:  ‚ö†Ô∏è Account or country (if multiple countries in one account) must have **at least 100 non-brand, non-shopping conversions** on a monthly basis.  To find this out, sum up all non-brand, non-shopping conversions you find in: 

* **Search/DSA campaigns** 
  + If dedicated brand and non-brand search campaigns existing: only consider non-brand campaign
  + If brand and non-brand traffic is mixed within one/multiple campaigns: make sure to filter only for non-branded conversions (e.g. through search term report)
* **PMax campaigns (non-branded)** 
  + If currently one asset-only campaign: take all those conversions into consideration
  + If currently full-funnel: check non-shopping share via platform insights (or Mike Rhodes script if no platform yet in use) and sum up all non-shopping conversions 
    - Image "image-20250512-140135.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399983559/image-20250512-140135.png?api=v2
  + If currently shopping-only: do not consider those conversions

 **üî¥ Negative Evaluation Result**  If, after this check, less than 100 non-branded, non-shopping conversions are generated on a monthly basis, Page Feeds are not a fit yet because we would have to conversion data for (at least) 3 campaigns (HI, LO, Exploration). Instead, consider a ‚Äòless advanced‚Äô shopping and non-shopping PMax campaign split like for example: 

* 3 Campaign Orchestrator campaigns (HI, ME, LO) shopping-only; make sure to still have enough conversions per campaign when switching to shopping-only. If this is not the case, do not split it!
* 1 ‚Äònormal‚Äô asset-only campaign

 Make sure to bill the Asset-only campaign if possible  As soon as the requirements are fulfilled and enough conversions are being generated, the upgrade from one ‚Äònormal‚Äô Asset-only campaign to Page Feed campaigns can be considered.  üü¢ **Positive Evaluation Result**  If at least 100 non-brand, non-shopping conversions are generated on a monthly basis, you can proceed with the next step. 2.)

| Dr. Nutrition AE (EN) | **Search**: Mixed campaigns (Brand & Non-brand)  **PMax**: Full funnel no Brand exclusion  ‚ö†Ô∏è For such cases: do not separate Brand at first to not have too many changes at once. Also, MRR would be lower due to Brand potentially not billed by smec (due to separation). | <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZiT4aQdseKqoWhebjE--W0VBw2sEea-EDyqPaWavXkU/edit?slide=id.g3079322f713_0_63#slide=id.g3079322f713_0_63> | What to consider for perfect campaign proposalBrand Treatment For majority of the cases, Branded traffic is already been separated, meaning: dedicated Search campaign is existing and smec PMax campaigns have Brand excluded. If this is the case, also exclude Brand from Page Feed campaigns.  If, such as for Dr. Nutrition (see table above), Brand is not being treated separately, do not separate it when starting with Page Feeds. Why: would result it too many changes at once, to little conversions for the Page Feed campaigns and less MRR (if this Brand traffic is not being billed by smec). Number of Page Feed campaigns The number of Page Feed campaigns depends on the current amount of Non-Brand and Non-shopping conversions per month, identified in [Step 1 (Fit Evaluation)](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399983559/How+To+Setup+and+manage+PMax+campaigns+with+page+feeds#Fit-Evaluation-(Client-CSM/PMM)):  | **Number of Non-Brand and Non-Shopping Conversions per Month** | **Number of campaigns** | **Campaigns** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 - 300 | 3 | High, Low, Exploration |
| 300+ - 600 | 4 | High, Medium, Low, Exploration |
| 600+ | 5 | Super High, High, Medium, Low, Exploration | If more than one account existing - where to launch Page Feed campaigns? The Page Feeds will be generated in the account which is linked to the smec platform. Therefore, the Page Feed campaigns should also be launched in this account. Playbook Pitch (Team + Page Feed CSM) Client Team (+ Page Feed CSM) pitches the Page Feed concept to the client.  How to pitch - Recordings: 

* DE Recording | DocCheck <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PfyDDVWAQvs_9ML9DbaUzis4mkGZ6Ov5/view>

3.) Contracting Phase (Teamlead/Account Executive)

* **Usage Fee as driver for share of wallet expansion** MANDATORY  It is necessary to establish the commercial basis for share of wallet expansion. This means that we need a contract that applies a **usage fee to PMax** campaigns managed or generated by smec (e.g. Campaign Orchestrator, smec Ad Automation Suite, ...). 
  + If the contract basis does not cover the usage fee on PMax, it is recommended to migrate the client to our new offering.
  + If a migration to a PMax-covering contract is not possible, contact [Christian Scharm√ºller](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/people/60dde34c7536500070bd2160?ref=confluence).
* **Setup / One-off** 
  + **Option 1 (Base Setup)** 
    - Requires a minimum incremental spend of ca. 5.000‚Ç¨ per month (assuming setup efforts of 8h maximum) in order to offer a setup free of charge. However, if possible, charge 2.080‚Ç¨ setup fee also if incremental spend of ca. 5.000‚Ç¨ is given.
    - If required minimum incremental spend of ca. 5.000‚Ç¨ per month is not given, 2.080‚Ç¨ setup fee has to be billed (= 8x hourly rate of 260‚Ç¨)
  + **Option 2 (Extended Setup)** 
    - Workload on ME side varies from case to case. Therefore align with ME how many hours of setup should be billed.

4.) Setup PhaseBusiness Logic Definition (Page Feed CSM/PMM)a) Setup Type Define which setup type should be implemented. 

* **Option 1** (Base Setup): Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs
* **Option 2** (Extended Setup): Product URLs + Custom Attribute URLs
* **Other** (e.g. mix): Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs + Custom Attribute URLs

b) Performance Thresholds Define which thresholds should be used for assigning URLs to HI, ME or LO Page Feed. Thresholds have to be defined per Page Feed (HI, ME, LO) and per URL Type (Product URLs, Landing Page Report URLs, Custom Attribute URLs). Google Ads metrics work for all URL types as the threshold. For Product URLs, also the Orchestrator score can be taken as the threshold.  **Example 1**: all URLs/URL Types should have a Google Ads Metric as thresholds, e.g. ROAS: 

* HI: ROAS above 4
* ME: ROAS between 2,5 and 4
* LO: below 2,5

 **Example 2**: Product URLs should have Orchestrator Score as the threshold (always indicate the percentiles!), all other URLs should have Google Ads metric as threshold: 

* High Page Feed: 
  + Product URLs: Orchestrator Score HI (100-80)
  + Landing Page Report URLs: ROAS above 4
  + Custom Attribute URLs: ROAS above 4
* Medium Page Feed: 
  + Product URLs: Orchestrator Score ME (60-80)
  + Landing Page Report URLs: ROAS between 2,5 and 4
  + Custom Attribute URLs: ROAS between 2,5 and 4
* Low Page Feed: 
  + Product URLs: Orchestrator Score LO (0-60)
  + Landing Page Report URLs: ROAS below 2,5
  + Custom Attribute URLs: ROAS below 2,5

c) Asset Group Logic Within the Page Feed campaigns you will have a regular Asset Group structure containing all assets. Therefore you need to define which Asset Group Logic each URL type will have.  **Example Option 1 (Base Setup):**  | **URL Type** | **Asset Group Logic** |
| --- | --- |
| * Product URLs * Landing Page Report URLs | **Product URLs:** should get **Product Type 1** as Asset Group Tag, which is e.g. *Shoes* (or Brand *Adidas Terrex* from MC Brand column)  **Landing Page Report URLs**: should get ‚Äò**Rest**‚Äô |
| This will result in the following Asset Groups:   * X Asset Groups based on **Product Type 1** (depends on how many Product Types the client has)    + Also possible: ‚Äòdedicated Asset Groups for PT *A, B* and *C*, rest should be one Asset Group *Rest Product Types* * 1 Asset Group ***Rest*** | |  **Landing Page Report URLs** will be a mix of category URLs, brand URLs etc. Therefore it‚Äôs not possible to define Product Type 1 as the Asset Group Tag for those URLs. Example: URL <https://www.engelhorn.de/de-de/herren/marken/a/adidas-terrex/> can‚Äôt get Product Type 1 assigned because this brand does not only have *Shoes* but also *Jackets*, *Gloves*, etc. as Product Type 1. Therefore, Landing Page Report URLs will all get the same tag which is e.g. ‚ÄòRest‚Äô.    **Example Option 2 (Extended Setup):**  | **URL Type** | **Asset Group Logic** |
| --- | --- |
| * Product URLs * Custom Attribute URLs    + Gender URL   + Shape URL   + Frame Color   + Material URL | **Product URLs**: should get **Product Type 1** as Asset Group Tag, which is e.g. *Shoes* (or Brand *Adidas Terrex* from MC Brand column)  **Custom Attribute URLs** will get the column naming as the Asset Group Tag:   * Gender URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòGender‚Äô * Shape URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòShape‚Äô * Frame Color URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòFrame color‚Äô * Material URL ‚Üí ‚ÄòMaterial‚Äô |
| This will result in:   * X Asset Groups based on **Product Type 1** (depends on how many Product Types the client has)    + Also possible: ‚Äòdedicated Asset Groups for PT *A, B* and *C*, rest should be one Asset Group *Rest Product Types* * 1 Asset Group ***Gender*** * 1 Asset Group ***Shape*** * 1 Asset Group ***Frame color*** * 1 Asset Group ***Material*** | | d) Link to Platform Page Feeds will be linked to an existing Platform Scope of the client. Why: the generated Page Feeds will be available in Google Ads through the Platform connection. This means: the account with the connection to the smec Platform is also the one where Page Feed campaigns should be launched.  Theoretically it is also possible to create a new Scope and link another account, e.g. account *B,* so that Page Feeds and Page Feed Campaigns get generated in this second account. BUT: this other account should contain Product URL performance and Landing Page Report URL performance. Otherwise no data for threshold calculation is available.

Overrides can be defined and added by the client team.  **Denylist**: Exclude landing pages. Can be defined on Landing Page level and can/should be used for steering by CSM/client.   * Add everything you would also exclude in a DSA campaign (e.g. home page, FAQ, impressum, blogpost pages, etc.)   **Allowlist**: the opposite of a denylist, means we only include landing pages based on the criteria specified in the list.   * FAQ side, Imprint, Blog,..   Further details should be aligned/clarified with ME.  This customisation sheet will be provided by ME and looks like this: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zdIX9c8sietcJSMQ13f6fkJiFG-2km7Xsmzr8TmTTMo/edit?gid=0#gid=0> |

### Content
Intro Within this how to guide we want to give you some guidance on how to set the tROAS & Budget for new ePMax campaigns with the tree-based approach.  This best practice approach was created by Data Science, the PMax Experts & Solution Engineering. It has been in place since April 3rd 2024. By following this approach for all new PMax setups we will be able to compare performance and generate learnings.  The PMax Experts will be monitoring and comparing the performance of all setups that follow the approach below and share their insights within the PMax Expert Round. Once we are able to generate learnings, we will update this guide and inform all CSMs in the CSM Knowledge Sharing Session.  **Questions?** If you have any questions, please direct them to [Patrick Hopf](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/people/6368b8fc847c699ac6513ecb?ref=confluence) who will be leading this initiative as the PMax Expert Leader. General Recommendations for PMax Generally, we need to reduce the frequency of changes in our PMax Campaigns to give them time to learn and optimize for the adjusted settings. This is the general recommendation from Google.  Google will re-trigger the learning on every significant change in a campaign (structure, or config) and the algorithm needs up to 2 weeks to fully learn and adjust towards the set goals.  We recommend: 

* ‚Ä¶ weekly updates for product assignments
* ‚Ä¶ changing the tROAS not more than once a week but ideally only once per 2 weeks
* ‚Ä¶ changing the Budget not more than once a week (significant Budget changes) but ideally only once per 2 weeks

How to allocate the products in the High, Mid and Low campaign Product allocation to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 3-way tree based split (high/mid/low): 

* Low score: max 40% of products
* Mid score: around 50-55% of products
* High score: 5-10% of products

 **Why is the number of products per campaign relevant:**  Because mid score should be the ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù campaign and high & low score should be the outliers in terms of performance.  **Why did we reverse the best practice and went back to the ‚Äúold‚Äù tROAS structure and suggest to have a higher tROAS on Low campaigns and lower tROAS on High campaigns?**  Yes there are some over-performing products with a way higher ROAS than we set (Hypothesis before). But what we have seen is that the majority of products, with a higher traffic volume (& the bigger impact on overall performance), have an average ROAS somewhere around our goal.  So in order not to kill those important products the safest option is to have the low tROAS goal for the high campaign.  **How do we set the tROAS, according to the client goal?**  Depending on the goal or the average ROAS the account reaches (actual ROAS not ROAS by Time) we set our goals: 

1. If the client goal is within +/- 10% of the average ROAS of the account we set the tROAS goals according to the client goal.
2. If the client goal is more than 10% off the account average we set the tROAS goals according to the account average and increase over time. (Example down below) Updated (18.07.24) How to set the tROAS and budget for new ePMax campaigns | **Campaign Split** | **Initial Setup** | **Example for Initial Setup**  Overall ROAS goal of Client: 10 Actual ROAS of client L30-90D: 8 (20% off Client Goal) Overall Budget: 10k | **Example for Initial Setup**  Overall ROAS goal of Client: 10 Actual ROAS of client L30-90D: 10.5 (within +/- 10%)  Overall Budget: 10k | **Comments/ Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low  (Prio 3) | tROAS: `Overall ROAS GOAL * 1.05`  Budget: `Overall Budget * 0.2`  Overall ROAS GOAL goal is defined by the client. If there is a specific ROAS goal for the PMax campaigns, use this as a reference. | tROAS: 8.4  Budget: 2k | tROAS: 10.5  Budget: 2k | * Cut back costs on lower scored products since they have the lowest budget/product and highest tROAS.   Keep a lower portion of products assigned to this campaign compared to `Mid` (max. 40% of products) |
| Mid  (Prio 2) | tROAS: `Overall ROAS GOAL * 1.0`  Budget: `Overall Budget * 0.4` | tROAS: 8  Budget: 4k | tROAS: 10  Budget: 4k | * Focus on target * Balanced   Make sure this campaign covers the highest portion of the products (around 50% of products). |
| High  (Prio 1) | tROAS: `Overall ROAS GOAL * 0.95`  Budget: `Overall Budget * 0.4` | tROAS: 7.6  Budget: 4k | tROAS: 9.5  Budget: 4k | * Push the highest scored products in regards to performance and/or product goals * Focus on max. conversion value as those products get the highest budget/product.   Keep a very low portion of products in this campaign (5-10% of products).  Keep tROAS as is and shift more budget from other campaigns to drive additional revenue when needed | Special Cases and deviations of the Best Practice approach We will stick to the approach above for all Tree Based setups. There will always be special cases, but generally we want to follow this approach and improve it over time.  Any deviations from this approach should be documented in the Jira Board:  <https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PSC/board>  ‚Üí [Patrick Hopf](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/people/6368b8fc847c699ac6513ecb?ref=confluence) will watch any cases that come in, to keep an overview  Process: 

* Once the ‚ÄúSolution Engineering‚Äù step in the Platform Onboarding process is done and the case gets handed back to ‚ÄúClient Office‚Äù you then have to update the case to ‚ÄúDone‚Äù. With tomorrow (24.05.24) there will be one additional mandatory field you have to fill to be able to set it to done:
* Best Practice (Mandatory field) 
  + **Yes** = everything was set up as described above
  + **No** = there were reasons to not go with the best practice ‚Üí please document and explain in the case
  + **Yes, but was changed after setup** = If you have to make drastic tROAS adaptions (e.g. tROAS 5 to tROAS 3 or the other way around) in the first week due to whatever reason ‚Üí please adapt the case option

 **Possible reasons not to go with the best practice (always in consultation from Solution Engineering)** 

* ShAA migration to Platform were Performance is right on target
* In Platform Scoring migration were Performance is right on target
* More than 3 Prios ‚Üí still tbd
* tbd How to push products within the new approach | **Time Frame** | **Best Practice** |
| --- | --- |
| **Long-term Push** | For Products that should be pushed in general (long-term), you should use the Product Goals.  This means:  If a product should be prioritised based on their strategic business information (e.g. high margin, low return, ‚Ä¶), then we should use an `Aggressive`/ `MoreAggressive`/ `SuperAggressive` setting.  This leads to the fact, that this product will get a higher score and are more likely to end in the prio 1 campaign. Even though, this campaign has a slightly higher tROAS set, there will be a push, as these products will get more budget attached to them as in the other campaigns. |
| **Temporary Push** (Seasonal Push) | For Products that should be pushed temporarily (Seasonal Push) there should be an extra campaign in addition to the approach from above. In the long run this could be solved within the tool. | Outdated - How to set the tROAS and budget for new ePMax campaigns **Why do we suddenly suggest to have a lower tROAS on Low campaigns and high tROAS on High campaigns?**  We noticed, that the Low scored products have a lower historical ROAS and high scored products are over-performing. Given the fact, that we also change the budget distribution and give High a lot of freedom, we need this new ROAS hierarchy to achieve the overall ROAS goal.  | **Campaign Split** | **Initial Setup** | **Example for Initial Setup**  Overall ROAS goal of Client: 10 Actual ROAS of client: Any Overall Budget: 10k | **Comments/ Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low  (Prio 3) | tROAS: `Overall ROAS GOAL * 0.8`  Budget: `Overall Budget * 0.3`  Overall ROAS GOAL goal is defined by the client. If there is a specific ROAS goal for the PMax campaigns, use this as a reference. | tROAS: 8  Budget: 2k | * Increase their the opportunity and conversion rate of low scoring products * Push stronger * Limit potential loss (low budget)   Keep a lower portion of products assigned to this campaign compared to `Mid` (max. 40% of products)  Monitor and reduce budget if tROAS is not achieved, keep focusing on opportunity with lower tROAS. |
| Mid  (Prio 2) | tROAS: `Overall ROAS GOAL * 1.0`  Budget: `Overall Budget * 0.35` | tROAS: 10  Budget: 4k | * Focus on target * Balanced   Make sure this campaign covers the highest portion of the products (around 50% of products). |
| High  (Prio 1) | tROAS: `Overall ROAS GOAL * 1.2`  Budget: `Overall Budget * 0.35` | tROAS: 12  Budget: 4k | * These products achieved ROAS is usually much higher than target anyways. * Focus on revenue and profit * Cover possible loss of opportunity costs for lower campaigns   Keep a very low portion of products in this campaign (10-20% of products).  Keep tROAS as is and shift more budget from other campaigns to drive additional revenue when needed |

This How To guide is only intended to be used when creating a completely new setup which was not done in the ShAA before. In case there already exists a setup in the ShAA and you want to migrate this, please refer to the following How To guide instead: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/D1iDHDkv>. Context This How To Guide provides a detailed description of one step among several necessary for setting up the campaign orchestrator. In case you did not already, please refer to the User Guide for an overview of the other steps: [https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/614858753/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-the-Campaign-Orchestrator](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980072/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-the-Campaign-Orchestrator). Image /wiki/download/attachments/571376317/Untitled%20Diagram-1710348903882.drawio-e6386356671054b3aa1e9f9487e4ab65cba61cc4.png?api=v2Prerequisites for configuring the campaign management in the platform There are currently some prerequisites for setting up the campaign management in the platform: 

* The performance score capability needs to be setup (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/HLGTszxx>) - smec Signals cannot be used
* For the campaign sync: Asset groups & assets are the same in all campaigns which are synced
* For the campaign sync: It is possible to create a template campaign in the Google Ads account

ConfigurationStep 1: CSM requests the subscription of the ‚ÄúCampaign Management‚Äù capability in the platform You do not need to request the subscription if the account already has that subscription. If you can see the entry ‚ÄúCampaign Management‚Äù in the sidebar, that account has that subscription.  Usually this step can be skipped, as per default the subscription is already given when the account is created. 

* Create the request using the following form: <https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PSC/form/57> 
  + Select ‚ÄúCampaign Management‚Äù in the dropdown ‚ÄúFeatures‚Äù

Step 2: CSM adds the Supplemental feed in the Merchant Center Next When upgrading existing scopes to Merchnt Center Next, the supplemental feed ID remains the same, the add-on is already active, so no action required. Activate add-on

* Go to the clients Merchant Center and navigate to the settings > Add-ons

* Select ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù in the ‚ÄúAdvanced data source management

Image "image-20240729-124018.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240729-124018.png?api=v2 The add-on is now visible in ‚ÄúYour add-ons‚Äù Add data via API

* To add the supplemental feed data, go to ‚ÄúData sources‚Äù > ‚ÄúSupplemental sources‚Äù

* Select ‚ÄúAdd product data using API‚Äù and choose the name of the supplemental feed according to our naming convention:

 `DO NOT DELETE: [Date] Campaign Orchestrator Setup | [Custom Label Agreed Client] | smec`  E.g.: `DO NOT DELETE: 2024-02 Campaign Orchestrator Setup | Custom Label 2 | smec` 

* Choose the primary feed:

Image "image-20240729-124845.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240729-124845.png?api=v2Copy the supplemental feed ID from the URL Image "image-20240729-125024.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240729-125024.png?api=v2Merchant Center Classic Image https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/images/icons/grey\_arrow\_down.pngMerchant Center Classic  **Add supplemental feed**  Go to the clients Merchant Center under Products > Feeds and add an ‚Äúempty‚Äù Supplemental Feed Image "image-20240209-092234.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240209-092234.png?api=v2 **Set the correct name and input method**  Make sure to use the Custom Label you agreed on with the client in order to connect smec signals with the Merchant Center.  `DO NOT DELETE` is added to the naming convention as it happened already that clients deleted the feed which causes a lot of work internally! 

* The naming convention is: 
  + `DO NOT DELETE: [Date] Campaign Orchestrator Setup | [Custom Label Agreed Client] | smec`
  + E.g.: `DO NOT DELETE: 2024-02 Campaign Orchestrator Setup | Custom Label 2 | smec`
* Select ‚ÄúContent API‚Äù as input method

 **Add to primary feeds** 

* Select the main feed that should be overwritten (eg. Germany)
* Save

 **Copy the supplemental feed ID** 

* Navigate to the settings of the supplemental feed and copy the Feed ID

Image "image-20240209-093301-20240716-095901.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240209-093301-20240716-095901.png?api=v2 Step 3: CSM creates a template campaign in Google AdsCreate the campaign itself in Google Ads (according to naming convention)

* The campaign should be paused as it should never actually be used
* The name of the campaign should be: `(targetCountry:smecPMax) Template Campaign - Do not remove or enable`, e.g. `(AT:smecPMax) Template Campaign - Do not remove or enable`

Setup the asset groups and listing groups

* The asset groups can be structured as desired and as possible given the available assets
* For the listing group, where you would normally filter for the campaign name in the custom label populated by the campaign orchestrator, filter for the value `Template` - or any other value. You have to enter this value manually, and can use the ‚ÄúBulk add values manually‚Äù option. This will be replaced in each campaign with the correct filter by the campaign sync. Image https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20230628-093452.png?api=v2

(Optional) Set up a fallback asset group

* You can set up a fallback asset group which will filter for all products which are not covered by any campaign (= does not have a custom label value which would connect it to one of the campaigns). The idea here is that it is better for a product to be covered by all campaigns instead of by no campaign. It can happen that a product is not covered by a campaign during temporary data issues (e.g. MC errors) or when accidentally creating invalid setups.
* For setting up a fallback asset group, you have to use the postfix `(Fixed Listing Groups)` at the end of the name of the asset group, otherwise the campaign sync will not be possible as the listing groups would be replaced with the corresponding values of each campaign.
* In the listing groups you can exclude all custom label values which are used for the target campaigns and include all other products. Note: This needs to be updated when creating new campaigns!

It is recommended to keep the default setting. | Step 5: CSM sets up the campaigns in the Campaign ManagementCreate Campaigns After all the settings are filled out, it is now possible to start adding campaigns in *Campaign Management > Campaigns*: Image "image-20240209-103133.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240209-103133.png?api=v2 The following attributes have to be set:

* The campaign name will be used by‚Ä¶

  + ‚Ä¶the campaign sync as name of the PMax campaign in Google Ads (in combination with the campaign name prefix)
  + ‚Ä¶the campaign sync for adapting the listing groups of each campaign to filter for the correct products
  + ‚Ä¶the MC export to populate the configured custom label
* The budget per day and the bidding strategy are used by the campaign sync to update the PMax campaign in Google Ads

The campaign sync will only use these attributes if an opt-out is not configured for the respective attribute.

### Set the Product Assignment **Keep in Mind** * The default product assignment is unrestricted. This means that a campaign without a product filter will be assigned all products and not none! * Priorities matter: if a product is assigned to several campaigns, the one with the higher priority will be taken After campaigns are created, the product assignment needs to be restricted for each campaign. This can be done by either adding product filters (where it is possible to filter by product type, brand, custom labels, orchestrator score, ‚Ä¶) or by filtering using Product IDs. When adding product filters for categorical attributes, such as product types and custom labels, it is possible to select a value from all of the currently existing values. In addition, it is possible to define values which do not currently exist in the feed, but you anticipate to be there in the future. It is possible to add several product filters, which are connected with an ‚ÄúOR‚Äù. This means that an item has to match either one of the product filters configured. Image "image-20240227-095416.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982520/image-20240227-095416.png?api=v2Enable the Campaign Sync When enabling the sync, you have two options: (1) Sync into an existing target campaign or (2) create and sync into a new target campaign, which will be generated directly by the campaign sync. * Option 1 - Syncing into an existing target campaign: There needs to be a previously created target campaign in Google Ads. You just enter the campaign ID and you can enable the sync. + As the Campaign Sync will overwrite all attributes which are included in the sync, it is irrelevant how these attributes are setup (e.g. the campaign name in Google Ads will be replaced by the campaign name set in the campaign management) + All other settings need to be manually set as they would normally without using the campaign sync (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/0RMieGa3>) * Option 2 - Create and sync into a new target campaign: When clicking ‚ÄúGenerate a new campaign‚Äù, the campaign sync will directly create a new campaign in Google Ads for this strategy when the next sync is triggered. + Until the campaign is generated, there will be no ID displayed, instead the text ‚ÄúCampaign will be generated with next sync.‚Äù + The campaign will not be generated until the next sync is triggered The campaign sync should now be displayed as enabled for this strategy. Step 6: CSM enables the Campaign Management and triggers a first roundtrip After adding the campaigns, it is now possible to complete the setup of the Campaign Management capability. To do so, navigate to *Campaign Management > Settings > Merchant Center Export* and *Campaign Management > Settings > Campaign Sync* and enable them. Once they are enabled, the changes will be applied to the Merchant Center and the Google Ads whenever the schedule triggers a run. In addition, the button ‚ÄúPublish Changes‚Äù should be available in *Campaign Management > Campaigns*. When clicking it, you will get an overview of what type of changes will be published before you actually publish the changes. Note that the publishing process can take several minutes or hours, depending on the size of the MC feed for the corresponding country of the setup. As a reference, for a feed with a size of 200.000 items it can take up to ~15 mins to finish. After publishing the changes, the status can be seen in the ‚ÄúEvent Log‚Äù. You will be able to see when a step in the workflow is started, and whether it finished successfully or failed.

Please note that as of August '24, the structural recommendations are disabled by default. If you wish to use them (eg. during scope setup or for re-structuring a setup), please enable it via Campaign Management > Settings > Recommendations > Checkbox Structural Recommendations

Prerequisites for setting up the recommendations (including the orchestrator score) There are some technical prerequisites for setting up the orchestrator score & recommendations. If you completed the setup steps in the order as described in the [user guide](https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/mgkT3TpT), these requirements should already be fulfilled. 

* The performance score capability needs to be setup (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/HLGTszxx>)
* There must be an overall goal as well as an overall budget set. Neither of these must use attributes which are marked as *documentation only*. (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/k0DroHUf>)
* The Score Approach must be ‚ÄúTree Based‚Äù. If this is not set up, please follow thise guide:[How To: Migrate to the tree-based performance score from the ads performance based score in the platform](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399983144/Deprecated+-+How+To+Migrate+to+the+tree-based+performance+score+from+the+ads+performance+based+score+in+the+platform)
* The Approach for Generating Recommendations must be set to Version 2. (Please contact slack channel #pd-platform-support if this is set to Version 1).

 New Scope Set Up: The Campaign Calibrator needs **3 days** of data for budget balancing recommendations and **7 days** of data for bidding strategy recommendations. ConfigurationStep 1: Enable the recommendations Navigate to Campaign Management > Settings > Recommendations and check the box to enable recommendations: Image "image-20240917-144105.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20240917-144105.png?api=v2Step 2: Apply the recommendations Once enabled, a new recommendation will be calculated in real time, every time you load the page (don‚Äôt expect a different recommendation with every reload though).  Please be mindful of the following: 

* Using the recommendations is not mandatory.
* Keep an eye on your client‚Äôs KPIs.

 For each generated recommendation, we offer an explanatory tooltip.  You can apply the recommendations separately by hitting the hook, or by hitting the ‚ÄúApply Recommendations‚Äù button to apply the all at once. If you want to publish the changes right away, click ‚ÄúPublish Changes‚Äù so the Campaign Sync is started: Image "image-20240917-145619.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20240917-145619.png?api=v2Specifics to Budget Recommendations

* Budget Recommendations are independent of tROAS recommendations.
* The overall budget is distributed among the campaigns.
* Campaigns where no budget recommendation can be generated (e.g. missing data) the budget set in the platform will stay the same.

   There are two options when a budget shift will be recommended:  A) Overall Budget is different to total sum of campaign budgets. (e.g. if you change the overall budget)  B) At least one campaign is *‚Äúlimited by budget‚Äù.* Then the budgets are shifted to give more room to campaigns that are limited and have a better ROAS performance.  Our definition of ‚Äú*limited by budget‚Äù* is that a campaign has an average daily spent above 90% of its daily budget in the last 14 days.  Additionally: If the internal calculated recommended budget shifts are too small (e.g. shift 1‚Ç¨ from campaign high to mid) there will be no recommendation shown as the effect would be insignificant.   Budget Examples **Example: No Budget Recommendation**  With overall Budget of 590‚Ç¨ and no campaign is limited: Image "image-20250204-102626.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-102626.png?api=v2Image "image-20250204-102718.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-102718.png?api=v2 **high:** spends on average only 212‚Ç¨ out of 300‚Ç¨ budget, see in tooltipp: Image "image-20250204-104402.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-104402.png?api=v2 **mid:** spends on average only 86‚Ç¨ out of 200‚Ç¨ budget, see in tooltipp: Image "image-20250204-104416.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-104416.png?api=v2 **low:** has configuration error and the set budget of 90‚Ç¨ will stay the same.    *As overall budget and the sum of all campaigns that are active (also the once with an error) are the same and no campaign is limited ‚Üí no recommendation is given.*    **Example: Budget Recommendation Overall Budget Change**  Same setup as previous example, but this time we reduce the overall budget to 400‚Ç¨. Image "image-20250204-103724.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-103724.png?api=v2 As there is a mismatch between the total sum of all active campaigns (590‚Ç¨) and the overall budget (400‚Ç¨) a recommendation is given: Image "image-20250204-103604.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-103604.png?api=v2 **low:** has an error and stays at 90‚Ç¨. Leaving a budget of 310‚Ç¨ to be distributed among high and medium campaign.  **high:** spends 212‚Ç¨ and gets a budget of 216‚Ç¨ Image "image-20250204-104252.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-104252.png?api=v2 **mid:** spends 86‚Ç¨ and gets a budget of 94‚Ç¨ Image "image-20250204-104306.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-104306.png?api=v2   *Why does the high campaign get only +4‚Ç¨ more budget than the average spend, but low campaign +8‚Ç¨ more?* *This is because high campaign performs worse with a ROAS of 3.65 and therefore is intentionally more limited than mid campaign with a ROAS of 6.1.*    **Example: Budget Recommendation ‚ÄúLimited by Budget‚Äù**  Same campaigns as previous examples, but this time the budgets are set different so that high campaign is ‚Äúlimited by budget‚Äù. Overall Budget is and the total sum of active campaigns are both 390‚Ç¨: Image "image-20250204-104926.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20250204-104926.png?api=v2 **low:** has an error and stays at 90‚Ç¨.

* Apply budget recommendations once a week. But you can also apply it more often than once a week.
* If you change the overall budget you should right away apply the budget recommendation so that the overall budget change materialises in the campaign budgets.
* Read the tooltip texts

Specifics to Bidding Strategy Recommendations

* Currently the only bidding strategy we support is tROAS bidding.
* tROAS recommendations are dependent on Budget recommendations: 
  + they calculate the recommended tROAS assuming that you will at the same time also change the budget as recommended
  + the tROAS recommendations work best if you have no campaigns limited by budget in this case you will not get budget recommendations anyway
* tROAS recommendations are dependent on each other: 
  + All the tROAS changes are recommended according to the overall Goal.
  + Only applying a subset of the recommended can lead to outcomes that are not aligned to the overall Goal.
  + It‚Äôs still OK to only apply some of the recommendations. 
    - look at the predicted effects of a single campaign shown in the tooltip to asses if an individual change makes sense.
  + If you don‚Äôt want to include a campaign to be part of optimisation towards the overall Goal you can opt out of it.
* Each campaign‚Äôs tROAS recommendation will deviate from the currently set tROAS by max. +18%/-18% (we use Google Ads data for reference).
* Don‚Äôt apply tROAS recommendations more often than once a week so they can work effectively.

Opting out of tROAS and/or budget recommendations You can opt out of tROAS and/or budget recommendations for individual campaigns. This setting can be found in the campaign settings: Image "image-20241119-060612.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20241119-060612.png?api=v2 The opted out campaigns are labelled in the campaign overview: Image "image-20241119-061136.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20241119-061136.png?api=v2 Please be aware of the following implications: 

* The overall budget used for recommendations consists of the overall budget minus all campaigns that are opted out of the bidding strategy or have a configuration error.
* Opting out campaigns from the bidding strategy means that their performance will not be considered for the overall predicted performance.

 Example Bidding Strategy opt-out:  Overall ROAS Goal of 10 

* campaign 1 has ROAS of 20 (is opted out)
* campaign 2 has ROAS of 5
* campaign 3 has ROAS of 6

 Overall **achieved** ROAS (of opt-in campaigns) is 5.5 ‚Üí recommendations will try to increase the ROAS to reach 10 Adjusting aggressiveness of the tROAS recommendations You can decide how fierce and fast the recommender will optimise campaigns towards the overall goal. This gives you more control and flexibility. The setting can be found in Campaign Management ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Recommendations: Image "image-20241203-124212.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399982326/image-20241203-124212.png?api=v2

* A value of 0 means the recommendations completely ignore the overall tROAS goal.
* A value of 1 means the recommendations fully prioritize reaching the overall tROAS goal, regardless of cost.

 Example:  Imagine we have three campaigns, each with a predicted ROAS of 6, assuming their current tROAS settings remain unchanged. The overall tROAS goal, however, is 10.  To balance between the current overall ROAS (6) and the goal (10), we aim for a middle ground. For example, we could adjust the campaign tROAS settings to target an ROAS of 8. This approach would correspond to setting a parameter value of 0.5, meaning we weigh the current ROAS and the tROAS goal equally.  If we want to take a more cautious approach and only slightly consider the tROAS goal, we could set the parameter to 0.1. This would mean we rely 90% on the current ROAS (6) and only 10% on the goal (10).

* Apart from the general platform setup, there are no prerequisites 
  + For the general platform setup please refer to: [https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/614858753/smec+Enhanced+PMax+in+the+platform+-+User+Guide#New-Setup-of-ePMax](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980072/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-ePMax).

ConfigurationStep 1: CSM enables the product goals You can enable the product goals in the platform by opening the scope of interest and navigating to *Goals & Budget > Settings*. Configure the following settings: 

* **Enabled**: Enable the product goals by selecting the check mark
* **Country**: Select the country of the scope (needs to be available in the Merchant Center which is configured for the scope)
* **Language**: Set the language to one of the languages available in the Merchant Center. This is the language in which the product filters will be defined - this is important for example when settings Product Filter on Product Types
* **Schedule**: Keep the default schedule. Please approach the platform support team via the slack channel #pd-platform-support in case you are convinced that you need a custom schedule.

Image "image-20240313-181921.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399981949/image-20240313-181921.png?api=v2Step 2: CSM adds product goals You can add product goals in the platform by navigating to *Goals & Budget > Product Goals*. The following attributes need to be set per Product Goal: 

* **Name**: Choose a name which shows the reason and idea behind this product goal
* Product to Campaign Assignment 
  + **Advertising Mode**: The advertising mode can be used to influence how the orchestrator score will be adapted for the products assigned to this product goal.
  + **Manually Managed:** see <https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/x/swA1Ow>
* **Status/Schedule:** A Product Goal can have following states: 
  + **Active** - The product goal is considered when processing the product to campaign assignment.
  + **Inactive** - The product goal is not considered when processing the product to campaign assignment.
  + **Scheduled** - The product goal is considered as active within the defined time frame and inactive outside the defined time frame.
* **Note**: This can be used to give further context and reasoning about this product goal

* The default product assignment is unrestricted. This means that a product goal without a product filter will be assigned all products and not none!
* Priorities matter: if a product is assigned to several product goals, the one with the higher priority will be taken  After creating a new product goal, the product assignment needs to be restricted, as otherwise all products will be assigned to this product goal. This can be done by either adding product filters (where it is possible to filter by their characteristics (product type, brand, custom labels, orchestrator score, ‚Ä¶) or filter by their performance (clicks, conversions, cost, etc.)) or by filtering using Product IDs.  When adding product filters for categorical attributes, such as product types and custom labels, it is possible to select a value from all of the currently existing values. In addition, it is possible to define values which do not currently exist in the feed, but you anticipate to be there in the future.

This ‚ÄúHow To‚Äù guide is intended for solution engineers, as solution engineering takes care of configuring the performance score. The parts which are relevant for CSMs can be found here: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/AysNeUwA>

What is it and how is it calculated? Please refer to [https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/614858753/smec+Enhanced+PMax+in+the+platform+-+User+Guide#Inventory-Scoring](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980072/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#Inventory-Scoring) for more information on what it is and how it is calculated. What are the steps for setting it up?How to switch an existing Performance Scoring configuration?‚Ä¶ navigate to *Inventory Scoring > Performance Score*Image "image-20240311-185759.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240311-185759.png?api=v2‚Ä¶ switch the Approach to ‚ÄúTree Based‚ÄùImage "image-20240311-185851.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240311-185851.png?api=v2Image "image-20240311-190750.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240311-190750.png?api=v2 Then continue with the [configuration of the performance score](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980820/How+To+Setup+Performance+Score+Calculation+based+on+Performance+Data+in+the+Data+Platform+Tree+Based#%E2%80%A6-configure-the-%E2%80%9CPerformance-Score%E2%80%9D). How to set up a Performance Scoring configuration from scratch? If not already done you need to request the setup up of the Inventory Scoring via following [form](https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PSC/form/34). ‚Ä¶ configure the *Inventory Scoring > Settings* In this section you can configure the general behaviour for the score calculation - this includes (to name the important ones) ‚Ä¶ 

* ‚Ä¶ *if the calculation is enabled*, so if the score is calculated according to the defined schedule or if no score is calculated at all.
* ‚Ä¶ *which data (inventory, ads performance) the calculation considers* - this refers to the data you are collecting via the Data Platform
* ‚Ä¶ *for which market the scoring data is created for* - this is necessary to have all data the collected and the produced consistently assigned to one market.
* ‚Ä¶ *which Language is considered for filtering the inventory data*
* ‚Ä¶ *how much past data is used for doing corrections in the data*
* ‚Ä¶ *according to which schedule the score is calculated* - per default (0 0 \* \* \*) the score is calculated every midnight. NOTE: This is the schedule for calculating the score and has nothing to do in which schedule the underlying inventory and ads performance data is collected!

Scoring Insights Overview The calculation will take some time - you can see in Scoring > Insights if the score is already there, by checking the snapshots: Image "image-20240313-145521.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240313-145521.png?api=v2 Once your snapshot shows up you can see the number of assigned products and the performance (conversions, cost, conversion value) per snapshot per cluster as an overview (**please see details below**). Image "image-20240313-152812.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240313-152812.png?api=v2Scoring Insights Details For figuring out if the split works for you, you then drill into a snapshot by clicking the three dots besides a snapshot. Image "image-20240313-153435.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240313-153435.png?api=v2 In the Snapshot Details you then see ‚Ä¶ 

* ‚Ä¶ how many products are assigned to each cluster ‚Ä¶
* ‚Ä¶ how did these assigned products perform over the last x days - e.g. 7 days in the screenshot below.
* Performance is represented by ‚Ä¶ 
  + Impressions
  + Clicks
  + Conversions
  + Cost
  + Conversion Value
  + ROAS (Overall ROAS per Cluster = Total Conversion Value/Total Cost)
  + ROAS (Avg) (Average(ROAS of Products) for according cluster)
  + CPA (Overall CPA per Cluster = Total Cost/Total Conversions)
  + CPA (Avg) (Average(CPA of Products) for according cluster)

Image "image-20240325-071904.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240325-071904.png?api=v2Playing around with different Splits You can play around with different splits in the insights easily - without breaking anything! All you need to do is change the ‚ÄúCluster Percentile (comma-separated, max. 10)‚Äù filter.  Ranges are right-inclusive only, i.e., cluster with between 0.3 and 0.6 includes products with scores > 0.3 and <= 60. 

* The first range is an exception covering also the 0 score value  The value you enter is a comma separated list of the upper boundaries (percentiles) of your clusters - so in the screenshot above you split your products based on the 50 and 100 percentile of the calculated score - which is entered in the form ‚Äú0.5,1.0) - which means ‚Ä¶ 

* ‚Ä¶ all the products with a score <= 50 percentile are in the first cluster and
* ‚Ä¶ all the products with a score > 50 (exclusive) and <= 100 percentile are in the second cluster.

 If you want to see what a split into three clusters would look like you can for example enter ‚Äú0.3,0.6,1.0‚Äù - which would mean ‚Ä¶ 

* ‚Ä¶ all the products with a score >= the 0 and <= the 30 percentile are in the first cluster and
* ‚Ä¶ all the products with a score > the 30 and <= the 60 percentile are in the second cluster
* ‚Ä¶ all the products with a score > the 60 and <= 100 percentile are in the third cluster

 And the insights would look like: Image "image-20240325-072119.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240325-072119.png?api=v2Playing around with different configurations If you want to see the impact of different configuration/weights for the splits - all you need to do is [adjusting the scoring configuration](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980820/How+To+Setup+Performance+Score+Calculation+based+on+Performance+Data+in+the+Data+Platform+Tree+Based#%E2%80%A6-configure-the-%E2%80%9CPerformance-Score%E2%80%9D) and run the score calculation again.  How to interpret the Scoring Insights Details and some recommendations for common scenarios can be found here - <https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/x/yoF5Jg> Apply split to Product to Campaign Assignment Once you found your ideal configuration for the score and the ideal split you can go ahead and translate your split into campaigns and their [product assignment via filters in the Campaign Management](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980820/How+To+Setup+Performance+Score+Calculation+based+on+Performance+Data+in+the+Data+Platform+Tree+Based#%E2%80%A6-assign-Products-to-Campaigns-using-the-Orchestrator-Score-Value). How can I use it for Google PMax? The tree based score is provided via the Orchestrator Score Value. This means the orchestrator needs to run to produce these values - to do so you need: 

* A defined (non-documentation only) Overall Goal
* A defined (non-documentation only) Budget
* Enable the preparation of Product Goals in Goals & Budget > Settings ‚Ä¶ configure the Orchestrator to use the Tree Based Approach Navigate to Campaign Management > Settings > General > Recommendations and select ‚ÄúTree Based‚Äù for the Score Approach ‚Ä¶ Image "image-20240311-191402.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240311-191402.png?api=v2 ‚Ä¶ then click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. ‚Ä¶ create one Campaign per Cluster as seen in the Inventory Scoring > Insights Details If the ideal split - you figured out in Inventory Scoring > Insights Details - showed for example 3 clusters you will create 3 campaigns in Campaign Management > Campaigns. For more details on how to do that please see [https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/571376317/How+To+Setup+Campaign+Management+ePMax+in+the+platform#Create-Campaigns](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399982520/How+To+Setup+Campaign+Management+in+the+platform#Create-Campaigns). ‚Ä¶ assign Products to Campaigns using the Orchestrator Score Value ***Reminder:*** The ‚ÄúTree Based‚Äù score is provided via the Orchestrator Score Value - and the Orchestrator needs following data to create this value per product: 

* Define a (non-documentation only) Overall Goal
* Define a (non-documentation only) Budget
* Enable the preparation of Product Goals in Goals & Budget > Settings

 Now, to assign products to campaigns using the Orchestrator Score Value, all you need to do is to define a product filter in the campaign details that matches the percentiles of your Inventory Scoring > Insights Details - e.g.: Image "image-20240325-072221.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240325-072221.png?api=v2 For the example above we would create following filters: Image "image-20240314-063512.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240314-063512.png?api=v2Image "image-20240314-064006.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240314-064006.png?api=v2Image "image-20240314-063919.png" https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980820/image-20240314-063919.png?api=v2 If you ask ‚ÄúWhy do the To and From overlap and will this result in the correct assignment?‚Äù - there are two things to understand: 

1. The boarders are inclusive - which means what you see is part of the defined filter - so the last filter above will contain all the scores for the percentiles 60 to 100.
2. As these filters are used in prioritised campaigns where a product can only be part of one campaign all the products matching the boarder will be part of the more prior campaign.

IntroductionContext This How To Guide provides a detailed description of one step among several necessary for setting up the campaign orchestrator. In case you did not already, please refer to the User Guide for an overview of the other steps: [https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/614858753/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-the-Campaign-Orchestrator](https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PN/pages/1399980072/User+Guide+-+Campaign+Orchestrator#New-Setup-of-the-Campaign-Orchestrator). Image /wiki/download/attachments/571375908/Untitled%20Diagram-1710348903882.drawio-3962864252f3fb5fedbe1bf0f86d5a053dc2cb71.png?api=v2Prerequisites for configuring the performance score

* User with access to the Google Merchant Center (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/weLnNnV6>) 
  + The items, which should be used for the campaign orchestrator, have to submitted through a feed where the feedlabel is set to the correct [two-letter CLDR country code](https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/gW0WaynH) of the country where the items should be advertised. For example, the feedlabel `AT` will work for Austria, but the feedlabels `AT1`, `DE`, `DACH`, `AT-DE`, `TEST123` will all not be compatible with the campaign orchestrator for Austria.
* User with access to the Google Ads accounts (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/gkiNdRB4>)

ConfigurationStep 1: CSM requests the platform setup via Jira

* Fill out the Jira Form: [Request for Inventory Scoring Setup](https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PSC/form/34)
* Help for finding the necessary information: 
  + **Summary**: The title of the Jira ticket, should follow the naming convention: `<client name> - <target country> - Inventory Scoring Setup`, for example: `Smarter Ecommerce GmbH - AT - Inventory Scoring Setup`
  + **Client/Account Name**: As defined in Salesforce/Clockify and platform link if applicable.
  + **Scope name**: Usually the same as the target country, if you will rollout ePMax for GSE and CSS add that information, e.g.: `AT-CSS`
  + **Merchant Name**: either same as Client/Account Name or name of the website
  + **Google Merchant Center ID**
  + **Google Merchant Center Refresh Token**: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/weLnNnV6>
  + **MCC**: Which MCC the Ads account is linked to. If you select ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù please specify in the description how it is possible to access the Ads account. Include a valid refresh token & the Authorizing Ads Account ID (see: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/RpneV2nV>)
  + **Google Ads Account ID**
  + **Target Country**: e.g. AT, GB, DE, ‚Ä¶
  + **Language**: Set the language to one of the languages available in the Merchant Center. This should be the same language as the language which will later be used for setting up other capabilities, and is relevant for example when defining product filters in the product goals and the campaign management. The performance data of all languages will be considered when calculating the score.
  + **Lookback Window**: by default 30 days, do not change this for now.
  + **Create VPC Predictions for Inventory Scoring**: This is only possible when using ‚ÄúAds Performance Based‚Äù approach, not the ‚ÄúTree based‚Äù Approach.
  + **Account Permission**: This defines the permissions for external users (of clients) later getting added to the account of this scope. Currently, ‚Äúedit‚Äùpermissions can only be given to accounts as part of the [Self-Service Pilot Pilot Programm](https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/T1b0VqTZ).
  + **Due date**: approx. 3 days
* After filling out the form, the case appears in this Jira board: <https://smec.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PSC/board>

 **Please align with your client regarding the schedule of the inventory import**. Depending on the size of the inventory, the import on our end can take quite some time, this is especially true for mornings where we experience the most stress on our systems. If the import is scheduled before client updates his catalog, we will run on the old inventory until the next run.

* Solution engineering receive a notification in the Slack Channel #sl-se-notifications

Image https://smec.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/1399980655/image-20230531-104658.png?api=v2

* Solution engineering sets up the inventory score. Detailed how-to guide: <https://smec.atlassian.net/l/cp/mx2u2S0q>
* Once the score is configured, it has to be moved to the section ‚Äúplatform onboarding‚Äù (this might look like if it‚Äôs going backwards, but it‚Äôs correct)

Otherwise they will face errors.  If you still need some of the data in the spreadsheet, keep it as it is, but make sure that the spreadsheet continue to have values, as this is needed for the ‚Äúvisitor‚Äù that Marketing Engineering built initially.
