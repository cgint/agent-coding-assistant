## Question 2
**Question:** How do I setup PMax campaigns with page feeds?

**Answer:**
Setting up and managing PMax campaigns with page feeds within the Campaign Orchestrator involves several steps, focusing on existing clients for wallet share expansion. The Page Feed approach aims to split PMax Shopping and PMax Non-shopping traffic for more granular steering, potentially increasing ROAS and MRR.

**Setup Options:**
*   **Option 1 (Base Setup):** Considers Product URLs + Landing Page Report URLs. This is the preferred option due to less effort required from Marketing Engineering (ME) and the client.
*   **Option 2 (Extended Setup):** Considers Product URLs + Custom Attribute URLs (with optional Landing Page Report URLs). This option requires more effort as the client must provide all desired URLs within Custom Attributes.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

**1.) Requirement Check:**
*   The account or country must have at least **100 non-brand, non-shopping conversions** monthly. If fewer, Page Feeds are not suitable; consider a less advanced shopping and non-shopping PMax campaign split.

**2.) Concept Phase:**
*   **Page Feed Playbook Creation:** Use templates to create a playbook.
*   **Campaign Proposal Considerations:**
    *   **Brand Treatment:** Decide whether to exclude Brand from Page Feed campaigns if already separated.
    *   **Number of Page Feed campaigns:** Depends on monthly non-brand and non-shopping conversions:
        *   100 - 300 conversions: 3 campaigns (High, Low, Exploration)
        *   300+ - 600 conversions: 4 campaigns (High, Medium, Low, Exploration)
        *   600+ conversions: 5 campaigns (Super High, High, Medium, Low, Exploration)
*   **Playbook Pitch:** Client Team and Page Feed CSM pitch the concept to the client.

**3.) Contracting Phase:**
*   **Usage Fee:** A mandatory usage fee applies to PMax campaigns managed by smec for wallet share expansion.
*   **Setup / One-off Fee:**
    *   **Option 1 (Base Setup):** Free setup if minimum incremental spend of approx. ‚Ç¨5,000/month is met; otherwise, a ‚Ç¨2,080 setup fee applies.
    *   **Option 2 (Extended Setup):** Bill hours based on ME workload.

**4.) Setup Phase:**
*   **Business Logic Definition:**
    *   **Setup Type:** Define whether to use Option 1, Option 2, or a mix.
    *   **Performance Thresholds:** Define thresholds for assigning URLs to High, Medium, or Low Page Feeds based on Google Ads metrics or Orchestrator score.
    *   **Asset Group Logic:** Define how Asset Groups will be structured for each URL type.
    *   **Link to Platform:** Page Feeds will be linked to an existing Platform Scope.
*   **Jira Case Creation:** Create a Jira case detailing the setup.
*   **Page Feed Generation:** Marketing Engineering generates the page feeds (lead time of 4 weeks).
*   **Campaign Setup (Client CSM/PMM):**
    1.  **Check Page Feed Settings in Platform:** Ensure settings are active and billable.
    2.  **Customization of Generated Page Feeds:** Double-check for needed overrides, denylists, or allowlists via a Customisation Sheet.
    3.  **Set up Performance Max campaign in Google Ads UI:**
        *   Create a new PMax campaign *without* adding products from Merchant Center.
        *   Add the matching page feed.
        *   Enable Text Assets.
        *   Disable Final URL expansion for HI, ME, LO campaigns; enable for Exploration campaigns.
        *   Do not pause old Search/DSA campaigns immediately.
    4.  **Set up asset group structure:** Collect assets and use the Asset Group Setup Template, specifying URL rules using page feed custom labels.
    5.  **Add negative KWs and Brand Exclusions:** Brand exclusions can be done in campaign settings. CSS and GSE campaign negatives can be requested via Google forms.
    6.  **Register campaign IDs for invoicing:** Forward Account ID and campaign IDs to billing.

**5.) Campaign Management:**
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor PMax Pagefeed campaigns, DSA-development, Search Terms, Landing Pages, Brand-development (if applicable), Display & Video Shares, and Quality of displayed ads.

**Microsoft PMax Campaigns with Page Feeds:**
For Microsoft PMax campaigns as part of the Campaign Orchestrator, prerequisites include using Google Merchant Center for Microsoft Ads. The setup involves calculating the performance score and populating the custom label in the merchant center. Campaign creation in Microsoft Ads is currently manual. The least complex option is using only Google performance data and the same score for both Microsoft PMax & Google PMax.

**tROAS and Budget Settings:**
*   Reduce frequency of significant changes (allow up to 2 weeks for Google's algorithm to learn).
*   Weekly updates for product assignments.
*   Change tROAS and significant Budget ideally not more than once every two weeks.
*   **Product Allocation (for a 3-way split):** Low score: max 40% of products; Mid score: around 50-55%; High score: 5-10%.
*   **Setting tROAS:** If the client goal is within +/- 10% of average ROAS, set tROAS goals accordingly. If more than 10% off, set tROAS goals according to the account average and increase over time.
